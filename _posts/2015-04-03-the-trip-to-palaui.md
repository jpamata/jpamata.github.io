<p align="justify">I along with my cousins JR, and Charles and a few friends were staying at Claveria, Cagayan at that time and we have been planning to go to one of the northernmost islands of the Philippines, Palaui. Fortunately, we know of this mountaineering club and they graciously offered to rendezvous with them. And so We slept past midnight and woke up at around 3:00 AM as group the meet-up was set at 4:00 AM. The first thing we did was a morning pump, ergo we did push-ups, situps, and planks in the morning to wake ourselves up and prep our bodies into a cover photo ready state lol. </p>

<p align="justify">We arrived at the meet-up place at 4:30 AM, only to find out that the other guys and girls are drunk and/or still sleeping haha! Anyway, it was a pretty good thing as we got to meet our companions (the sober ones). By 5:30 AM, we were on our way to Palaui :)</p>

> On our way to Palaui!

<p align="justify">We were supposed to travel with a big boat to cross the sea, but we arrived later than scheduled and so we would wait for 2 hours <strong>at the least</strong> for the next big boat that'll take us there. Since we're all itching to go there, we rented the services of 3 bangkeros and their small boats to take us there which took us an hour and a half of sea travel (their boats were damn slow).</p>

<p align="justify">We wasted no time and we anxiously took off all our bags and other gears and left them at the boats to hike our way atop the Palaui hills to Cape Engaño.</p>

<p align="justify">On our way down, we stopped by to marvel the view. And also to take a kick ass shot :D</p>

<p align="justify">... we found a cascade! The following picture shows what we did upon seeing this cool, refreshing, oasis:</p>

<p align="justify">The girls decided to take some rest while the boys of the group satisfied their primal urge to strip and take a dip ha!</p>

<p align="justify">With the sun about to set in, we took a boat to get to the other side of the island which is where we will spend the night to. The boat ride was different this time as the night approaches and the waves are getting bigger and stronger.</p>

<p align="justify">The site where we set up camp on was on a village that depends on solar power as it's source of electricity, so yep it's really dark at night. For our dinner, we paid a nearby family to cook us some fish and chicken :) </p>

<p align="justify">The drinking session started at 8:00 PM, and it lasted until midnight lol. At some time we ran out of drinks (we were drinking Emperador Brandy) and we had to scour the town for at least one big bottle. It was an adventure on its own for it became a treasure hunt as we broke into groups and looked for a shop just with the pale blue moonlight lighting our way. </p>
