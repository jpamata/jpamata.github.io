> Go where you are celebrated, not merely tolerated. - Paul F Davis

<p style="text-align: justify;">We've been planning this trip for the past week, just six of us. A few days went by and we invited others to our trip; just our friends from our block. As the saying goes, the more the merrier... right? It's a bit sad though that they couldn't come. We were hoping for them to come, even though we expected them not to as they're not much keen into these kind of outings.</p>

<!--more-->
<p style="text-align: center;">Anyway, enter this day: April 14, 2015. A Tuesday. Day of our trip.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was morning, and we met on our QUAMET class. I brought some snacks for the trip, just half a dozen tuna sandwiches to feed us some protein for the trip (We're manly men who need as much protein as we can). It all seemed to go well as we talked fervently about our trip but then we had a quiz on our Information Security class. Nice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn't study for it, not that I don't want to but I can't as I hadn't known about the quiz nor the lessons beforehand. I was absent for the past two meetings: I got sick from food poisoning (got it from Palaui) on our Monday class, and our make up class conflicted with another class of mine. Fuck. That. Shit.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm going to pass that subject anyway. Yes, I am that good.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After class, we met at the cafeteria and waited for the other guys to finish their class. I forgot who made the initiative to prod us to go to Tagaytay but at around 9:50 we started the journey. We were supposed to buy some liquor first at Shell Magallanes but the prices were too damn high!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We opted to buy them at some place instead. For the road trip soundtrack, we played a dozen gym and workout tunes in the car as I (the elected DJ for the day) forgot to picked the music for the job. Anyway we were really ecstatic on the road.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We stopped by Petron I think, and had our lunch at around 10:25. That's right, it took us less than 20 minutes for the trip from APC to SLEX. I heeded to my cousin's advise, which is to always roam the way to the gas station's restrooms whenever you stop by one to check out for chicks. And he was right! I spotted a 7 outside ha!</p>

> Saw something we like

<p style="text-align: justify;">After our meal we went on our way to Laguna. By the time we've reached Walter Mart, Sta. Rosa,  I received a text from Mico. He was asking us on where the hell we are. FUCK. We forgot about him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He didn't attend our first class and we didn't get a text message from him that morning so we all thought that he wouldn't come. We made a decision there to come back for him, even if the expense of our action would make us shell out PHP 400 for the trip. Though since we were already at Walter Mart, we settled on buying some liquor there first.</p>

> Came back for this bro

<p style="text-align: justify;">So we came back, paid almost PHP 200 for the trip back, and then another PHP 200 to head towars Laguna again. Upon arriving at APC, we chilled down for a good quarter of an hour as we were all nauseous on the way back - thanks to our driver who drove around 110 km/h on average. And again on the way to Laguna, we were cruising past the 100km/h line; and to feel the fresh blast of air from the trip, we opened the windows.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We stopped by a local store, 7-11, to buy some food for the trip and our friend Mico had lunch at the nearby Burger Machine branch. There was this homosexual there flirting with us (yes, not casual talk) who kept asking us personal details. I gave in and gave my friend's name (Jim) to the guy. I even asked him to add me on facebook with the given name lol.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With the food dilemma crossed out, we got into Nile's car and drove straight to Nuvali. Windows down, everyone smiling, gangsta music blaring, me enjoying my cheeseburger... Fuck it felt good.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We arrived at Nuvali, Laguna at around 1:00 PM I think, and the first thing we did was to park the car and set up camp. Others changed their clothes as the formal wear's been a bog down to us. We then brought out the drinks and chips that we bought and had our moment there by the lot, drinking and having a great time. With the drinks gone, we were all looking for some H20. And so, four of us went to the local convenience store to buy some mineral water while the other two left and stayed in the car.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the way to the store, we decided it would be better to wander around, take a gander and have some snapshots of the place. The park was great! Clean, tidy, has great stores and a picturesque setting. All that was missing were the women! I haven't been to this place before but I think this is not a good place to spot chicks. Though we came there during the day - a hot time during the day - which kind of explains why there's only a few people, the place looks like a date/family outing venue!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We headed to Tagaytay a quarter to 3:00 PM. With only a handful rolls of money in our wallets, we knew that we're not going to afford a trip to Sky Ranch. So we just decided for a meager drive-by for the view. <em>"It's not about the destination. It's about the journey" </em>is what they say.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a great road trip. Any problems we had, we left it back home. Far from the cities where we were tied down to our obligations, we got a taste of freedom.</p>
