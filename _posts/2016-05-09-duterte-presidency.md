title: "Holy Moly! Duterte's Going to be Our President!"
author: "John"
description: I admit. I am not an expert and I do not claim to be one. How can I? I'm just an undergrad who hasn't gotten a glimpse yet of the industry; I haven't put in as much time as others had. But whenever I talk to people about putting their content out there, their voice on the matter, they would often tell me of not being good enough.

<p align="justify">Today’s election day and from the looks of it, Mr Duterte is going to win. Welp. Nothing much to do but to accept this fate. I’m a citizen and I need to respect his position as president because if I don’t, then what is the point of electing presidents? Like Richard Gordon tweeted:</p>

<p align="justify">Anyhow, I surely do hope that the outrageous things that Mr Duterte promised during his campaign are just for the sake of showbiz and garnering votes. Please Sir Duterte, please prove me wrong.</p>
<p align="justify">On one hand, that hefty salary increase for government officials looks good. My dad who’s contemplating about retiring from the government early and move abroad might just change his mind and stay in this country for a bit.</p>
<p align="justify">Aquino’s sound economic achievements/policies and massive improvements on provincial infrastructure, and Arroyo’s policies geared towards in foreign investors and various economic projects, it should shield us for at least the first couple of years in case Duterte does something bad.</p>
<p align="justify">Still, it’d be great to be an OFW now. The dollar will surely fly high under a Duterte presidency but like all things in economics though, things will settle in time. Controversies will fly around, the media will have a heyday, stocks will take a roller coaster ride, and other political parties and power players will take advantage of his presidency.</p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps I might take advantage of a big "if" situation: Everyone in the US knows that a turbulent economy is great for the young’uns; younger people have the opportunity to buy stocks at a lower price and the time to watch those stocks mature. Every time the US enters a recession or some turbulent economic situation,  it also comes back stronger than before; after all, recessions it's part of the cycle, it’s healthy.</p>
<p align="justify">Riding from the waves that Aquino spelled that made the PH the fastest growing economy in Asia for years (credit upgrades were due to good governance practices, fiscal management, and the corruption war that improved foreign investor confidence), the Duterte administration is set for a huge economic jump. It’s just a great time to open an account at COL Financial or at BDO Nomura to buy some stocks.</p>
<p align="justify">This time though, I may not have to wait for that to happen.</p>

> Going back a few months ago:
<p align="justify">I remember the first few weeks when Duterte filed for candidacy, my dad and I were drinking a beer at the time, and he exclaimed “Ah si Duterte, mukhang game changer yan.“</p>
<p align="justify">He’s right.</p>
<p align="justify">Let’s all hope that it’s for the better.</p>
