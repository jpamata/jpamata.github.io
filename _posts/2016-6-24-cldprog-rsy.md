<p align="justify">Just  a series of old screenshots from my project in cloud programming last term, a website for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RSY-Fitness-Gym-268524300015901/">RSY Fitness Gym</a> that was hosted in MS Azure. Unfortunately I didn't have any more new screenshots for the polished/finished product and I can't take any new shots as the MS Azure trial has expired. </p>
