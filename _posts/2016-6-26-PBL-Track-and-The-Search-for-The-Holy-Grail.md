It is the 3rd week of class and we still haven’t gotten a sound project idea for our PB. You see, in my school's curriculum, we have this thing called a Project Based Learning track where a student will propose a project that will undergo the entire systems development lifecycle through a set of classes. Previous PBL tracks had the students working on a project with a real client but this year is different.

Much to my bewilderment, we were ordered to have a research-themed project. 

There are just too many topics to ponder about, that it should be easy for us to pick one.

Should we go with NLP?

How about Machine Learning?

Dive into algorithm research?

Tinker with compilers?

Computer Vision perhaps?

So many cool topics and so many ideas for us One problem sticks out though:

**We have to be able to present a working prototype by the end of the term.**

And so, in great fashion, the announcement left our entire block stressed and ogling on their computer screens for a good amount of time. There was silence in the room but the sound of silence sounded like thunder. As of now, I’ve only thought of the following project ideas:

| Topic                                    | Field | Notes                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Handwriting Analysis                     | CV    | Build a software that analyzes an image of a person’s handwriting (with focus on baseline analysis),  to give a prediction on a person’s personality. |
| Question Answering                       | NLP   | Build a system that automatically answers a question that is posed on a given topic |
| Word Sense Ambiguation using Evolutionary Algorithms | NLP   | Study the effects of different evolutionary/genetic algorithms on the process of WSA |
| Sentiment Analysis                       | NLP   |                                          |
| Anomaly Detection                        | ML    | Simulate a “spy/intruder/fraud/criminal” detector by creating sets of data that includes each person’s attributes and develop an anomaly detection software to find it. |
| Predicting the future with Twitter       | ML    | Analyse tweets on twitter and make an **ATTEMPT **to extrapolate the data in order to predict the future. |
