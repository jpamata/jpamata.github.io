title: "College: PBL Track and The Search for The Holy Grail"
author: "John"
description: It is the 3rd week of class and we still haven’t gotten a sound project idea for our PB. You see, in my school's curriculum, we have this thing called a Project Based Learning track where a student will propose a project that will undergo the entire systems development lifecycle through a set of classes. Previous PBL tracks had the students working on a project with a real client but this year is different.

<p align="justify">It is the 3rd week of class and we still haven’t gotten a sound project idea for our PB. You see, in my school's curriculum, we have this thing called a Project Based Learning track where a student will propose a project that will undergo the entire systems development lifecycle through a set of classes. Previous PBL tracks had the students working on a project with a real client but this year is different.</p>

<p align="justify">Much to my bewilderment, we were ordered to have a research-themed project. </p>

<p align="justify">There are just too many topics to ponder about, that it should be easy for us to pick one.</p>
<!-- more -->  
<ul>

<li>Should we go with NLP?</li>

<li>How about Machine Learning?</li>

<li>Dive into algorithm research?</li>

<li>Tinker with compilers?</li>

<li>Computer Vision perhaps?</li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">So many cool topics and so many ideas for us One problem sticks out though:</p>

**We have to be able to present a working prototype by the end of the term.**

<p align="justify">And so, in great fashion, the announcement left our entire block stressed and ogling on their computer screens for a good amount of time. There was silence in the room but the sound of silence sounded like thunder. As of now, I’ve only thought of the following project ideas:</p>

| Topic                                    | Field | Notes                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Handwriting Analysis                     | CV    | Build a software that analyzes an image of a person’s handwriting (with focus on baseline analysis),  to give a prediction on a person’s personality. |
| Question Answering                       | NLP   | Build a system that automatically answers a question that is posed on a given topic |
| Word Sense Ambiguation using Evolutionary Algorithms | NLP   | Study the effects of different evolutionary/genetic algorithms on the process of WSA |
| Sentiment Analysis                       | NLP   |                                          |
| Anomaly Detection                        | ML    | Simulate a “spy/intruder/fraud/criminal” detector by creating sets of data that includes each person’s attributes and develop an anomaly detection software to find it. |
| Predicting the future with Twitter       | ML    | Analyse tweets on twitter and make an **ATTEMPT **to extrapolate the data in order to predict the future. |
