# I believe that productivity is a skill. 

Just like every other ability, therein lies techniques to help you refine your prowess in this important skill . This post is about the four techniques that I use to amp myself from “slacker mode” to “warrior mode” in a few minutes. 

> \1. Sets and Reps

<p align="justify">One good piece of advice that I got from reading Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Total Recall was to implement the Sets & Reps method from bodybuilding to your daily life .</p>

- Barbell Overhead Press 5 x 12 (5 sets of 12 repetitions)
- Rehearse Speech 8 x 1
- Read Book 6 x 15 Minutes

<p align="justify">I have found that for studying, breaking your time evenly to sets and reps such as the one I did for the last task above had worked for me the most out of all the great studying advise out there. Whenever I need to take a break, I’d pause the timer then unpause it once I get back.</p>

<p align="justify">Personally, 15 minutes is short enough for a focused study session. Once you’ve gotten acquainted to it, the impact of crossing off those sets and the visual feedback you’d get would lead to your motivation and discipline firing up.</p>

>  2. Plan ahead

<p align="justify">When you have a goal in mind, you don’t float around aimlessly. Goals ought to also be specific: prioritise it, set up a deadline, write some notes, etc.</p>

<p align="justify">Once those are done, I’d put them on a calendar app, to-do app, a piece of paper or anything else that gives you a visual reminder of the goal.</p>

> 3. The **Reality Check** writing exercise

<p align="justify">One thing that’s quite fun to do is to set a 15-20 minute timer, open a text editor or get a notebook and pen, and within those minutes write about your life. I’d often start writing about (my plans in) the future then afterwards get down to the present. After a few minutes of self contemplation, you’d either motivate yourself about your success, or you’d either motivate yourself from the looming failure.</p>
