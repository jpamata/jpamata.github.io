# On Sitting
<p align="justify"><strong>Sitting is Harmful</strong> In 2009, researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana published a study suggesting that the amount of time a person sits is directly associated with mortality from all causes. The study examined 17,013 Canadians over a period of twelve years. The researchers measured each participant’s time spent sitting over those years and adjusted for factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. In the end, they found that the participants who sat the most were fifty percent more likely to die prematurely.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Change Often</strong> Dr. Hedge recommends sitting for no longer than twenty minutes, but you shouldn’t stand for longer than twenty minutes at a time, either. The key is to keep your body moving—adjust your position often and take many breaks.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Change If It Hurts</strong> If you’ve been standing for a few minutes and your legs or feet are starting to hurt, then sit down. Likewise, if you’ve been sitting and your back or shoulders start to hurt, then stand up. Neither of these positions should be painful, so the best position is the one in which you are able to hold good posture.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Stand Often</strong> An advantage of standing is that it’s not sitting. This simple fact means that standing can reduce your risk for many of the diseases we discussed in the previous section. To be specific, standing forces the muscles in your legs
and abdomen to contract more often than when you sit. This is important because when those muscles don’t contract, your body suppresses the production of an enzyme in the skeletal muscle called lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL plays an important role in transporting fats and breaking down fat-carrying molecules in the bloodstream. When the enzyme is not available, fatty materials can build up on the walls of your arteries.</p>

# On Eye Strain
<p align="justify"><strong>Blink Often</strong> Blinking moistens your eyes and replenishes the protective film that coats the cornea. When working at a computer, you tend to blink less often—about five times less than normal. This causes your eyes to dry out more rapidly. As a result, you need to force yourself to blink—ideally every twenty minutes. Close your eyes slowly, as though you are falling asleep, and repeat ten times.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Exercise Your Eyes</strong> The primary reason that eyes become tired or fatigued is that they are focusing at a single depth for a long period of time. Think of holding a heavy object—after a while you need to shift it around. That’s exactly why it’s good to exercise your eyes. Rely on the 20-20-20 rule. That is, look away from your computer every 20 minutes, focus on an object that is 20 feet (6 meters) away, and look at it for 20 seconds.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Take Breaks Often</strong> You’re probably getting tired of being told to take breaks. But here’s one more reason: according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, discomfort and eye strain were significantly reduced when computer-workers took four additional five-minute “mini-breaks” throughout the work day.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Take Off Your Prescription Glasses</strong> Many people with myopia (nearsightedness) don’t actually need their glasses when using a computer. Try taking them off—you may find that you can see just fine. In fact, most optometrists recommend taking off your glasses whenever it’s possible.</p>

# On Headache
<p align="justify"><strong>Drink Water</strong> Dehydration contributes to headaches in many different ways. It creates a chemical imbalance by reducing the quantity of essential salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. It also leads to a drop in blood volume, which lowers the blood and oxygen levels in the brain. This causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate and swell, which results in the feeling of a headache. As a result, one of the best ways to prevent headaches is to drink plenty of water. A recent study from the Institute of Medicine determined that adult men need roughly 3.7 liters (about 16 cups) of water per day and women need roughly 2.7 liters (about 12 cups) of water each day</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Dim the lights, lie down, close your eyes, and try to relax.</strong> That’s the best way to treat a headache, because it has no side effects and won’t cause a rebound headache. If possible, place a cool wet towel on your forehead. Despite its simplicity, this strategy has proven to be effective.</p>

# On Back Pain
<p align="justify"><strong>Support Your Body</strong> Adjust your chair height so that your back is properly supported. Your hips should be level with your knees so your are not sliding forward or backward in the seat. You’ll also want to adjust your desk height so that your elbows are level with your wrists. This will help relieve strain on your shoulders that can ripple down your back.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Go for a Walk at Lunch</strong> The benefits of walking are undeniable, and the most relevant benefit to this discussion is that walking can help reduce back pain. Decades ago, doctors recommended bed rest for patients with back problems, but today we know that activity is the best prescription.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Keep Your Feet on the Ground</strong> One of the most overlooked aspects of posture is the importance of keeping your feet on the ground. This helps support the weight from your legs and keeps you balanced. If your feet are not touching the ground but your position is good otherwise, then you may want to use a small footrest to prop up your feet.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Cat Back (Cat-Camel)</strong> Dr. McGill recommends beginning each routine with the cat-back exercise, which is intended to reduce spine viscosity (that is, internal resistance and friction) by lubricating the nerve roots where they exit the spine. It is essentially a warm-up for your back. Keep in mind that it is intended as a motion exercise, not a stretching exercise. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/cat-camel">Link to Exercise Instructions</a></p>

# On Life
<p align="justify"><strong>Drink Enough Water </strong>We’ve already discussed the relationship between hydration and headaches, but hydration affects your immune system, as well. Dehydration creates a chemical imbalance in your body that prevents the immune system from functioning at it’s best. So keep drinking eight glasses of water each day (follow the 8x8 rule), and remember to stay
hydrated during and after exercise.</p>
    
<p align="justify"><strong>Get Your Vitamin D</strong> It is clear that vitamin D plays an important role in the immune system. In fact, a deficiency in vitamin D has been shown to increase the risk of infection. Your ten minutes of unprotected sun exposure each day should help improve your immune function and restore balance in your health.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Get Enough Sleep</strong> We don’t know the exact number of hours one should sleep at night—it probably differs from person to person—but we do know that losing sleep, such as by staying awake for twenty-four-hour periods, has a negative impact on the immune system. One of the first studies to demonstrate this came from the University of Lübeck in Germany. Researchers vaccinated participants against hepatitis A. One experimental group slept after the shot while another group stayed awake. Both groups were tested four weeks later, and the experimental group showed a twofold increase in certain antibodies. In general, a good amount of sleep is probably between seven and nine hours, and going without sleep is really bad</p>

<p align="justify"><strong> Stop and smell the roses</strong>—literally. Some natural scents, such as evergreen,
may promote the production of anticancer proteins.</p>
