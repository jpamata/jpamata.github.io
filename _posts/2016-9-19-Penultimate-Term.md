# Will this be my penultimate term or will my date for internship will be moved to September?

I am seriously hoping that this term would be the second to the last term before I enter internship. This term is hard. Not just because of the personal tasks that I ought to accomplish by the end of this year, but also the academe work. My classes for this term looks daunting; SCSPROJ, DESALGO, NATSER2, COMPORG, ENTJAVA, OCCP.

Let’s break down these subjects:

**SCSPROJ**/Applied Project for Computer Science-Systems Software: I have to finish coding our natural language processing project which is a Medical Question Answering System.

**DESALGO**/Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Algorithmic analysis, algorithmic strategies, sorting and searching, graph algorithms and geometric algorithms. Fuck.

**NATSER2**/National Service 2: Laborious community work as a form of social welfare training. Once a week, we’d spend a day doing social work for street children, NGOs, public organisations, etc.

**COMPORG**/Computer Organisation: Listening from the previous batch who had taken the class, I’m guessing it’ll be full of Arduino work.

**ENTJAVA**/Enterprise Java: The development of server-side applications based on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Sounds fun –  yet also full of work.

**OCCP**/Oral Communication Competency Program: I am still unsure of what this subject is.
