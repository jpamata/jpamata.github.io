description: I am seriously hoping that this term would be the second to the last term before I enter internship. This term is hard. Not just because of the personal tasks that I ought to accomplish by the end of this year, but also the academe work. My classes for this term looks daunting; SCSPROJ, DESALGO, NATSER2, COMPORG, ENTJAVA, OCCP.

A brief reflection on four important notes from the days spent doing our undergrad thesis: preparation, reading, writing, and the experience.


> On preparing

<p align="justify">I started preparing for the thesis as early as SYSADD1 (Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design 1) where I chose to work on a niche field in natural language processing: Question-Answering Systems. It was supposed to be extended until our thesis but I realised on how few projects I would be adding to my portfolio after I graduate. So by November of 2016, I started borrowing books from the school's library on topics about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. All those preparation, I found, really helped us on our thesis. Because of my knowledge in the area of AI, even though the depth of my knowledge was too shallow, it gave me an idea on which direction the group would pursue. Still, it was not enough. I should've stuck myself into a single topic and dove deeper. </p>

> On Reading

<p align="justify">The best advice I've gotten on delving into the various academic texts were gotten from S. Keshav's How to Read a Paper (2016). In it, he describes a three pass approach. The first pass is all about getting an idea of the paper by reading over the title, introduction, conclusions, and references. At the end of the first pass, you must be able to know the 5Cs: Category, Context, Correctness, Contributions, and Clarity. The second pass is about grasping the content of the paper by reading the paper as a whole and noting the discussions, terms, and formulas. The third pass is about understanding the paper in depth by attempting to "recreate" the paper. This is done by looking for the strengths and weaknesses of a paper: How strong is the lead up towards the conclusion? Are there any typos or errors? How about the citations? Is it presented well?</p>

> On Writing

<p align="justify">During the duration of the thesis, I made it an objective for the group to pick a damn article/related literature(s) that they'll do for a weekend, read it, make a summary of it, and then write about it. Afterwards, they'd write at least 5 sentences a day for the entire week. </p>

<p align="justify">Think of it this way: Say you've got 10 days before the midterm defense. You pick one literature tomorrow or the day after, then read and summarise. That's a day off and now you've got 8-9 days to write about it; at the very least, that's 40 sentences by the end of the week. That's about 2-3 paragraphs. And if you want to make your write up longer, read and write about some of the bibliography/cited works from the article. Afterwards, whatever the team has accomplished by a given date, I'll be requesting their individual input as our professor expects to see a sample document on certain days. After that day, we'd continue improving the writeup. Most of the time, </p>

> On the Experience

<p align="justify">We started our thesis kinda late.  By the third week, we still haven't settled on a topic to pick, and at first, it was only I who was proposing ideas: An Evolutionary Computing (Genetic Algorithms) Approach to Simulating and Optimising Traffic Routes and Lights, Smart Text Summarisation of Thesis Documents, and another topic that I seem to have forgotten about. It was by the second month where we have settled into a topic, which was an interest of Eman's. The topic was about the Mitigation of the Attrition Rate of Employees by Gamification. The idea was to build a web app that would be handed and then answered by the employees. Afterwards, the results would show which employee is close to leaving the company. Since it was a bit not related to computer science, I proposed to add some elements of natural language processing by using some simple sentiment analysis on the project. Two weeks after, we changed the topic again due to the problem of finding employees to hand out the web app to. If there's no data, we're done.</p>

<p align="justify">Now judging  from what I have seen by that time, pretty much all of us were into making machine learning  or data analysis as the field for our thesis. That's good, as a project in  machine learning shows an advanced knowledge in computational skills, which would help us if we're going for a deeper field in comsci. It's good and all but looking  back, frankly, we have sort of slacked into this project. We were all looking  and waiting for someone from our group to save our asses and it all came to  bite us back in the end. Now with a couple weeks before the midterms, I took charge and started to take things seriously. From gamification, our topic changed to machine learning algorithms for employee attrition forecasting. Ms Rabago seemed to like it and recommended that we ask the human resources department of the school to hand us out some data.</p>

<p align="justify">Speaking of data, the fact  of the matter was, our only problem was our dataset - there is nothing else that  is far more important. It doesn't matter if you have an idea that's good; if  you can't find a dataset for it, then it will not push through. </p>

Since then, we saw our road diverging in three-ways:

1. Continue with an anonymysed dataset (IBM Dataset)
2. Asia Pacific College’s HR Data
3. Find another dataset and go with another topic

<p align="justify">As it stood, our project was heavily dependent on the dataset that Asia Pacific College will provide since Ms Rabago wanted us to pursue attrition forecasting in that area. I did not make any expectations that APC will give us all the Human Resources (HR) related data that we'll need as it is extensive and laborious: past histories would have to be pulled out and sensitive data like Educational Background, Job Descriptions, Gender, and Compensation Packages (salaries, benefits) would have to be readied for us. </p>

<p align="justify">So with that in mind, I asked my group to anticipate that we have a high chance of switching to IBM's dataset after the Midterm. Nevertheless, it was obvious that Prof. Rabago had an inclination for us to work with APC, so our strategy for midterm was to ride on the prospect that APC will hand us all the data that we'll need in order to get a high grade this midterm from Miss Rabago and the Panelists.</p>

<p align="justify">Only then after the midterm grades were put out, when we will continue with IBM. So for our midterm agenda, we focused on gathering literature that will make us look like we're doing something revolutionary for Asia Pacific College.</p>

<p align="justify">I asked my group to prepare for the defense by reading about the benefits of applying machine learning to HR, to read about the general problems (preferably business cases) with regards to employee turnover/attrition, and also read about the recent academic studies on HR machine learning.</p>

The point was to skew our midterm to Prof. Rabago's favour. You could say that it wouldn’t matter in the end, but by then you’re making it a zero sum game.  

In general, what we were aiming to accomplish for our midterm defense are to:

- Articulate the problem wanting to be solved.
- Defend the significance of our study. What improvement to the field are we adding?
- Make at least 3 BIG Points.

Midterm came and we saw a 3.0 (or 3.5, I think) grade. Not a bad grade, at least regarding the fact that we mounted a sprint to make a decent paper in less than 2 weeks. During our midterms defense, the following were the comments/issues raised by the panelists:

- Can the project be applied to the Philippine setting?
- If it is, will it affect the accuracy of the model?
- Make the objectives more clearly and non-technical.
- Specify the common  forecasting models.
- Can we stick to the current model instead of looking for a new one?
- Find a relation between background and objectives.
- Work on the title.
- Attrition Rate vs Business Analytics
- Is neural network a useful tool in analyzing employee attrition rate? 
- Where do you think neural network would fit best? 
- Analyzing human behavior is bias / A lot of bias in neural network  (Will the Biases/Weights on Neural Networks affect the prediction?)

<p align="justify">Judging from the midterm defense, as expected, most of the questions that were asked were mostly about the problem itself. The reasoning is simple, you can’t expect the panelists to be knowledgeable in machine learning or technical enough to understand the concepts. That’s not how it works in the real world. It’s all about the problem in general and the idea. If you can't explain the problem to the general person, then it ain't really that much of a problem isn't it?</p>

<p align="justify">Thus, I expected that even though we'll successfully develop and prove our objectives during our finals defense, the questions from the panelists would still mostly revolve around the background of the problem and the significance of our project. So our MAIN OBJECTIVE here is not the development of neural networks but instead, our goal should be to answer the question: </p>

<p align="center">What is the significance of our thesis as a contribution to the field of computer science?"</p>

<p align="justify">To answer this question will require tons of research on the background. So whenever my team mates have time, I asked them to research and make write-ups on how our thesis is different to others, how ours is better, how big the problem of attrition is globally, the general problems, why our method is better than other forecasting models and what are they... Virtually look for anything else that they think will make our thesis look novel. </p>

To accomplish the feat and lay claim to the road to internship, the group and I went through the following plan:

- March 13-19: is when we started learning the development of the neural network and start learning how the weights are trained. In this week, we shall start reviewing the dataset and schedule meetings with Sir Joaquin Bamba for regression/forecasting advice.
- March 20-26: is for the construction of the network and the evaluation. Most likely, only the feedforward neural network (FNN) will be developed by this week. Nevertheless, we shall decide if we can still push through and develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) depending on the constraints of time. If we can't, then we shall write a theoretical study on RNNs as chapters on frameworks and future studies.

<p align="justify">It isn’t a necessity to go through every resource or topic (or even finish one) to understand the project’s concepts. After all, you can just watch a 30-60 minute video or read a 20 minute article on neural nets and be sufficient enough to have an informed conversation with the panelists.</p>

<p align="justify">Nevertheless, you can never go wrong with being too knowledgeable so I gave my group a bunch of resources to study and asked them to find a way to motivate themselves. I told them that if you’re planning to attend grad school for an MS in Computer Science (either because you want to work as an academic, in AI, or want to get an H1B Visa to work in the US) take it as a preparation. If they’re looking to get a trophy, then I told them to be glad that they’re doing an undergrad thesis in on a graduate level topic. And if they just want to finish the courseload, then I asked them to do well so that in the future they could grab a letter of recommendation from the professors. Some of those seemed to motivate them.</p>



<p align="justify">The weeks went by and although there were some irregularities with the team's performance, we managed to pull off and submit a paper for finals. Yet despite of the praises received, it was by no means, a fine work. It was not a smooth ride. I had to revisit a lot of maths and spend some time on the weekends studying the maths required to understand the process. The team also encountered some dramas. In spite of all of these, we saw it as a victory. The point of a thesis is to venture to the unknown, and going through such adventure required us to conquer a few demons. We fought off procrastination. We picked a subject we know so little of and didn't surrender. I faced my math phobia. We instilled the value of self-education. We grew confident of our abilities to absorb new materials. And then in the end, we've grown into each other. It was certainly a victory; not of the paper, but of the self. </p>
