> The First Two Weeks

<p align="justify">I started my internship on May 4, a Thursday. For the first week (May 4 & 5), it was mostly spent on getting to grasp the company and its projects. They showed me this vantage page where I filled up some personal details and went through a few online courses about the company. I also attended a couple meetings about the company's projects. On the second week, I met up with a former developer intern, Joanna, (she was there to process her internship papers for graduation) and she showed me how to set up my attendance/time logging with an app called DTCapture.</p> <!--more-->
<p align="justify">Actually, one of her major projects during her internship was the development of DTCapture where it automatically logs in your Time In/Time Out on the database. Afterwards, you'd visit the web app, note down your time in/time out, put it on an excel spreadsheet that's following the company's template, print it out, scan the </p>

<p align="justify">According to her, you are marked late if you arrived at 9:30, and the half day starts at 11:00. Sweet.</p>

<p align="justify">She also solved a problem of mine which I have been enduring about, the constantly lagging/performance issues with my computer. As it turns out, the problem exists due to one process. The solution is to simply run the task manager, go to processes, look at the advanced option that shows the hidden processes, login "siemensdatmigration1", enter the password, find the svchost process and then kill it. Joanna said that it's best to just leave the computer running for the rest of the week rather than shutting it down everyday. The boot time is horribly slow because of the network syncing. For this reason, Joaanna recommended to only shut down the workstation every Fridays.</p>

> The Work

<p align="justify">During my internship interview, I had gotten the idea of what the company is and what it asks of its interns - .NET Development. So as what one sane person would've done, I studied some bit of the .NET world for the upcoming work. Unfortunately, all the time spent on studying were not enough to prepare me for the work ahead. Why? Because the projects were cluster bombs of different tech and libraries jumbled into an ASP.NET solution. </p>

<p align="justify">They also have this VBA training program, which I think is a brilliant opportunity for interns but frankly, I am yet to attend a single meeting even though I get invitations to it. For the past couple of weeks, I've went thru dozens of meetings about the onboardings, the projects, and a few meetings to discuss the team metrics. I've also done some JQuery to scrape up the data for application testing as my first real work. I didn't had any experiences with JQuery though but luckily, Sir Matthew lended me a hand. For the next work, I was given the task to debug a code issue on how the excel output for a report from the web app is having some problems with rendering the values. I spent I think a couple of days or so before I realised that the problem was with the language type, that the app doesn't accept such values. It was frustrating at first because I literally had no idea on how to approach the problem. I went through method by method then line by line of the code (commenting out some lines or editing some values) to see on which part of the code results to the issue. I was like a blind man groping for the door handle. Nevertheless, that experience taught me how to read error reports from Visual Studio to diagnose the problem. To say that I did it on my own would be a lie, I got some help from Sir Mark about the language problem.</p>


<p align="justify">Aside from learning the ecosystem of Microsoft, one must also learn AngularJS and JavaScript. This free online course is what I used to grasp the basics of it: <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs">codeschool - AngularJS</a>. This article also helped: <a href="https://toddmotto.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-angular-js-in-one-day/">Ultimate guide to learning AngularJS in one day</a>. I've always heard that JavaScript would be among the programming language of the future and will be seen everywhere from mobile to desktop - they were not kidding.</p>

<p align="justify">The team executes well. They follow the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile">Agile approach to Software Development</a> and they do all the agile ceremonies: tasks are given at the beginning of a sprint (2 weeks long), daily standup meetings to make a quick report of our status, iteration reviews and retros (retrospective/reflection) at the end of a sprint, and sprint plannings.</p>

> My Average Day

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hK8Pvfw.png" align="center"></div>

<p align = "center"> *AM* </p>

**[6:00]** Alarm goes off. Read a book, typically memoirs and self-improvement books.

**[7:00]** Finally Wake Up. Get out of bed, eat breakfast, bath, brush teeth. If still don't feel like it, I play piano or browse the net.

**[8:30]** Arrive at office. Open facebook, ycombinator, reddit, and read up the latest articles on business and tech.

**[9:00]** Start looking at yesterday's work to prepare for a standup report/updates. 

**[9:30]** Meal at Mcdonald's. I actually don't need to eat, but the stroll from the office to the nearby Mcdonald's is my "morning coffee".

**[10:00]** Normally, a team standup meeting is scheduled at this point. Around this time I get some tasks & then I'd add them to my to-do app. Thereafter, I'd research ways on how to solve that task and make a plan of action.

**[11:00]** Lunch


<p align= "center"> *PM* </p>

**[12:00]** This is when I start executing my plan of action, whether that be coding, hacking around the project, or learning the technologies required.

**[2:00]** Either I get some snack or I go out for a 5-10 minute walk to stretch my back.

**[3:00]** Team usually  goes out to have a snack. Either that or there is a meeting. On the occassions that there's none of both, this is when I put my headphones on, some Frank Sinatra or some repetitive instrumental music plays, and thereafter I'd transcend into deep work status.

**[4:15]** Productivity breaks down and I start browsing the net. I start asking my seniors for help if I'm not done yet with my task.

**[4:45]** Cannot concentrate anymore! At this point, the only thing you'll see on my screen are a bunch of google chrome tabs and skype. I'd probably go to the nearby mcdonald's or the pantry for some snack.

**[5:00-5:15]** Elvis has left the building.

**[6:10/6:30]** If I arrived at work late, this is the time I'd leave for home.

**[7:00]** Dine and shower. In that order. Showers are long as I contemplate about the universe and my life.

**[8:00]** Either read a technical book (science, technology, math) or learn some new shit.

**[10:00]** Sleep. If I can't sleep, I read a fiction book to put me to sleep.
