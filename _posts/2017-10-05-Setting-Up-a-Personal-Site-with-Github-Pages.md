<p align="justify">I have just recently moved this site from github pages to a namecheap domain. Without reinventing the wheel or anything I'll just stick to linking the tutorials that have helped me do it.</p>

1. <p align="justify">Supposing you don't have a Github Pages site to begin with or have little idea of what it is, I recommend going through Karl Broman's tutorials: http://kbroman.org/simple_site/</p>

2. <p align="justify">https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages</p>

3. <p align="justify">https://support.google.com/a/answer/6248925?hl=en</p>

4. <p align="justify">https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9758/2208/how-to-set-up-zoho-email-for-my-domain</p>

<p align="justify">From time to time, you will come across (or not, if you're lucky) some infinite redirection errors. Don't fret, it's okay. You have just created and moved to a new domain. Still, if it persists for more than 48 hours, it's best to mail your domain provider.</p>
