<p align="justify">I have just recently moved this site from github pages to a namecheap domain. Without reinventing the wheel or anything I'll just stick to linking the excellent tutorials that I've followed to the bone to get this site up and running.</p>

<p align="justify">#1. <strong>Hosting with Github Pages. </strong></p> 
<p align="justify">Github Pages allows you to host a static account free of charge, under the <i>*.github.io</i> domain. Supposing you don't have a Github Pages site to begin with or have little idea of what it is, I recommend going through Karl Broman's tutorials: <a href="http://kbroman.org/simple_site/">kbroman.org/simple_site/</a></p>

<p align="justify">#2. <strong>Getting a Custom Domain</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Once you have your site up and running on github pages, it is now time to buy a domain from namecheap. <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages">How do I link my domain to GitHub Pages?</a></p>

<p align="justify">#3. <strong>Building Your Web Presence with Google Webmasters</strong></p>
<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6248925?hl=en">Google Domains: Verify your domain</a></p>

<p align="justify">#4. <strong>Your Free Custom Email with Zoho mail</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9758/2208/how-to-set-up-zoho-email-for-my-domain">How to set up Zoho email for my domain?</a></p>

<p align="justify">From time to time, you will come across (or not, if you're lucky) some infinite redirection errors. Don't fret, it's okay. You have just created and moved to a new domain. Still, if it persists for more than 48 hours, it's best to mail your domain provider.</p>
