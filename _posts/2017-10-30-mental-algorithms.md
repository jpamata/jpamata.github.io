<p align="justify"> When thinking about problems, people usually have two ways to tackle such situation.
</p>

<p align="justify"> Let's consider the graph below.

<p align="justify"> The graph is an example of an undirected graph, of which the graph in this case is mathematically represented as <strong>G</strong>. The vertices, the nodes are represented as <strong>V</strong> and the edges, or the lines connecting each vertices is represented as <strong>E</strong>. Formally, we can then define the graph as <strong>G</strong> = {<strong>V</strong>,<strong>E</strong>} where <strong>V</strong>,<strong>E</strong> are unordered pairs of <strong>V</strong>.

<p align="justify">In computer science, the two most common ways to traverse such graph are breadth first search and depth first search. Breadth first search is when you traverse such graph by exhausting all the nearest vertices from the current/source vertex before moving on to vertices on the next level. Say in the graph above, <strong>G</strong> your source vertex is 1, <strong>s</strong>, you would first traverse into vertex 5 and 2, the reachable vertices or edges of <strong>s</strong> before you move on to the next level, where 4 and 3 lies. This in real life can be associated to thinking broadly.
