      While you're out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning.

  <p>  --- Arnold Schwarzenegger </p>
  <p align="justify">Out of all the quotes I've heard, it is the one that has always stood out to me the most. Simply because it is something that forces you to think about defeat - yours, precisely. Since then, I've used it as a way to assess my life. <i> Am I spending my time correctly? Am I doing the right thing? Which should I prioritise? </i> These are such questions that arise as I ponder about the said quote. And as my internship is drawing to an end, I see the same thoughts popping up as I reflect on the question, <i>What's  next?</i></p>

<p align="justify">In a month, I am to depart from Willis Towers Watson and enter the world as an undergrad facing the job market. So the answer to the question, <i>What's next?</i>, is of course to keep busy. That could be either with getting another job, studying, or working on a new project. I would like to work on a new project, that is what I'll do, yet at the same time I need to find a way to finance my ventures. So the priority then, is to find a job.</p>

<p align="justify">I've a little knowledge of the IT job industry in the country, yet enough to understand that it is a competitive one. Yes, we all know that there's a high demand for IT workers but the demand is for competitive, skilled workers. I've heard stories from my friends and from strangers of typical interview practices and processes and what employers look for fresh grads. With these knowledge, I developed a plan to prepare myself for the Job Market, one that I'll follow as early as today to January. This blog post details the plan that I've made, a three pronged attack on the following: </p>
<ol>
   <p align="justify"> >><strong>Presence</strong>: to get the interest of headhunters & get the opportunity to either an interview or to submit my resume. </p>
   <p align="justify"> >><strong>Projects</strong>: to pass the resume filters and get to the interview </p>
   <p align="justify"> >><strong>Knowledge</strong>: to pass the interviews and get the job </p>
</ol>

<h2>Three - Pronged Attack</h2>
<hr>

<h3>1. Presence</h3>
<p align="justify"><strong>Build a good personal website:</strong> the place where I tell everyone a bit of myself, so I have to make a professional-looking, clean website. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Update Social Media accounts:</strong> my social media should show what I like to do and should point out to the projects I've made. To include my web SEO further, it should include links to my website and other public accounts in the web.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Update GitHub account:</strong> tech savvy hunters would sometimes look for a strong github account that either has top quality code or shows consistency (passion) in programming. My github account is pretty barren so I plan to add a simple project and put all the codes I've done from algorithmic/programming exercises.</p>

<h3>2. Projects</h3>

<p align="justify"><strong>Web App</strong>: to show that I have the skills to develop a full stack application</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Mobile App</strong>: to show that I have the skills to develop an app in an OOP language</p>

<h3>3. Knowledge</h3>

<h2>Plan</h2>
<hr>
<h3>November</h3>
<p align="justify">The goal for this month is to review the fundamentals behind the languages, and so I am currently taking up udacity courses on Java and the 30 days of Code from HackerRank. To review some web development fundamentals, I have also started doing the exercises from the FreeCodeCamp, doing the 7 days of JavaScript from HackerRank and finishing up the 30 Day Vanilla JS challenge. All of these should be finished by the end of the month. I will also attempt to finish an ethereum app this month, along with a full stack javascript application to add to my portfolio.</p>
<h3>December</h3>
<p align="justify">On December, I will start tackling algorithms. Starting with the Udacity course on technical interviews and doing the exercises from the Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python online book. I will start with some warmup challenges as well on HackerRank and a bunch of easy problems from URI, which fortunately for me has a huge stack of easy problems (at least compared to HackerRank and codewars). I will start using Anki for chunking in fundamental knowledge; review some basic Networking, OS, OOP, and Java-specific questions.</p>
<h3>January</h3>
<p align="justify">January will be about polishing my projects and preparing myself for a discussion of em. Nonetheless, the focus for this month is on getting better at algorithmic challenges.</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<hr>
<p align="justify">It is quite a large curriculum and there is a strong chance that I might not finish it all. Nonetheless, though accomplishing such feat would be great, it'll be perhaps an overkill for common fresh grad jobs. Still, you can almost never be wrong with having too much of something. Also, I must look beyond the outlook on the entry-level job market and into the experienced professional market. Thus, undergoing such endeavour is not just to lend me my first job, but also an investment for my future.</p>
