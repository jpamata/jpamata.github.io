<p align="justify">I first heard of blockchain 3 years ago when a friend of mine coerced me to mine bitcoin (BTC). Back then, I didn't paid it much attention, but I did do his suggestion thinking "Why not? It's free money." Mining was easier back then, and I had gotten around 0.01 BTC from that few weeks of venture. My friend was more fortunate, getting a sum of 1.34 BTC after several months. He sold it eventually for PHP 20,000. Now if he had held til today, he could've sold it for more than half a million Philippine Pesos.</p>

<p align="justify">I've quickly forgotten about BTC after that venture, until I heard about it again this year, around April, on Hacker News. Looking at the local exchange, it was selling for around PHP 60,000. I was surprised at the rapid increase, so I read more about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Eventually I got the book "The Age of Cryptocurrency" to delve more on the topic. It took me some time to realise that we are entering an era. I knew that something big is happening, and I could either stand here and watch, or be a part of it.</p>
