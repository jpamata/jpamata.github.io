> First Contact

<p align="justify">My “first contact” with Willis Towers Watson began on the 25th of March. It was at a Job Fair hosted by Asia pacific College. A friend of mine recommended the company to me, claiming that he’s exuberantly working on developing web apps for the .NET platform. It seemed far from my calling, as my only encounter with the .NET ecosystem was when I was working on my final project for CLDPROG (Cloud Programming) a year ago – and even then I was just playing around with it, the professor never asked me to build the project with .NET. </p>

<p align="justify">Nonetheless, it piqued my interest as another friend of mine who’s also an intern at Willis Towers Watson, gave it a thumbs up. And so on the day of the Job Fair, Willis Towers Watson was at the top of my list of companies to talk to. Actually, they were the only one whom I handed out my resume to during that day. Having been quickly sold from my conversations with the visiting employees and my friends.</p>

<p align="justify">Days later, on the 28th of March, a Monday, I received a call and an e-mail from Mr. Joey Hernandez about an internship opportunity at Willis Towers Watson. It was kind of surprising as I was actually on my car, riding home. I had to wait ‘til I get home before I could answer the call. It was an invitation for an interview at Willis Towers Watson. It happened so fast, I was expecting at least a week before I could get a reply. I guess I could thank Asia Pacific College for that, perks of being an industry partner I reckon.</p>

<p align="justify">The initial interview was a behavioral one. The night before, I spent my time studying the the company’s background and mission. I woke up early, around 5:00 AM, just to brush up on some basic software development concepts: object-oriented programming and version control. I also spruced up my personal website (hosted through github pages, which I’ll soon be buying a domain name for by the end of September: <a href="https://jpamata.github.io/">https://jpamata.github.io/</a> ) which would serve as my online portfolio that I could reference at any time during the day and at the same time serve as a proof that I am familiar with git version control – one of the things that I have learned under Sir Sean’s SYSADD class. Unfortunately, all that cramming of information weren’t much of any use for the initial interview, as it was a behavioral one. They asked me about my accomplishments, my biggest problems and how I’ve gotten around it, and lastly, my projects.</p>
> The Work

<p align="justify">Two days later, I got an e-mail again from Willis Towers Watson again that I had passed the initial interview, inviting me for the final interview at their other office. It was a technical one. Most of the questions were about my projects, specifically, they were design questions: “Why did you choose X? Why implement X instead of Y? What’s the difference between X and Y?” Aside from that, I was also quizzed on my familiarity with object oriented programming. I was very composed during the interview, they had asked me nothing that I haven’t learned in school and my previous self-studies during my free time. It was a serious, formal interview until we were finished with the technical questions – that was when we began to fool around, have some chat and some laughs. After the interview ended, I went straight to Asia Pacific College to attend my afternoon class. I felt victorious and that translated to my enthusiasm in class. I had always played down the value of classes, preferring instead to work on side projects rather than attend and pay attention to my classes. But from my victory that day, I began to see how important the things that they teach in class, especially the lessons on data structure and software development.</p>

<p align="justify">On Friday, 2 days later, I got an e-mail that I had passed the interview with flying colors.</p>

> The First Month

<p align="justify">For the next work, I was given the task to debug a code issue on how the excel output for a report from the web app is having some problems with rendering the values. I spent I think a couple of days or so before I realised that the problem was with the language type, that the app doesn't accept such values.</p> 

<p align="justify">It was frustrating at first because I had absolutely no idea on how to approach the problem. I went through method by method then line by line of the code (commenting out some lines or editing some values) to see on which part of the code results to the issue. I was like a blind man groping for the door handle. Nevertheless, that experience taught me how to read error reports from Visual Studio to diagnose the problem. Later, I learned about Visual Studio's debugging tool.</p>


<p align="justify">Aside from learning the ecosystem of Microsoft, one must also learn AngularJS and JavaScript. This free online course is what I used to grasp the basics of it: <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs">codeschool - AngularJS</a>. This article also helped: <a href="https://toddmotto.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-angular-js-in-one-day/">Ultimate guide to learning AngularJS in one day</a>. I've always heard that JavaScript would be among the programming language of the future and will be seen everywhere from mobile to desktop - they were not kidding.</p>

<p align="justify">The team executes well. They follow the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile">Agile approach to Software Development</a> and they do all the agile ceremonies: tasks are given at the beginning of a sprint (2 weeks long), daily standup meetings to make a quick report of our status, iteration reviews and retros (retrospective/reflection) at the end of a sprint, and sprint plannings.</p>

> INTERN1

<p align="justify">Come June, I knew that this’ll be the company that I would be stuck with until the end. It was June when Asia Pacific College sent out a letter to the company to seal in the deal: that I’d be interning here ‘til the 15th of December. There will be no turning back now and that I’d now have to start taking it seriously. Around that time, I was still a bit hesitant on continuing my journey at Willis Towers Watson. Trend Micro and Asurion’s internship offers were like a gem to me, as I’d get to tinker around with the technology stack that interests me. </p>

<p align="justify">What really sealed the deal for me was the company’s summer outing. It was the day when I really got to know the team’s culture and the interesting characters of the group. I truly revered how they had the time to fool around and at the same time progress in their careers, so that – for a while – removed any notions that I have about getting my internship at another company. I decided then, to go with the flow.</p>

<p align="justify">June was mostly spent working around the front end issues such as tinkering with some JavaScript to render some requests for a financial web app. The team executes well. They follow the Agile approach to Software Development and they do all the agile ceremonies: tasks are given at the beginning of a sprint (2 weeks long), daily standup meetings to make a quick report of our status, iteration reviews and retros (retrospective/reflection) at the end of a sprint, and then back to sprint planning. The days of June usually began with me arriving at the office at 7:00 AM and procrastinating with some previous work from yesterday to come up with a good standup report. Afterwards I’d be given some tasks by 10:00 – 11:00 AM, a one-hour lunch break with the team, and then start working on my new tasks from 12:30-3:30 PM. By 4:00 I am on my way home.</p>

<p align="justify">July was when I got exposed to background tasks and while helping a fellow developer intern, it was also when I started familiarizing myself more with the MVC framework. For me, July was a test on how I could adapt to a different environment. It was July when they pulled me to work on another project, a workforce management system, which was a desktop and web application. There were days where I’d rue about coming to work because I was expecting another day where I would feel dumb. It was very stressful for me as after a day of coding at work, I would come home and get back to more coding. I had to sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge if I were to solve the puzzles that I was tasked with. I began to get exhausted. I needed a break.</p>

> Learning Enough to Survive

<p align="justify">Around August, I met up with Benjamin, a friend of mine, on one of the seminars that APC hosted. It has been a while since we had talked so we had an hour catching up at Max’s. We shared our experiences on the internship, and I told him one thing that at the time, I haven’t shared with anyone: “I’m fed up with my work”. </p>

<p align="justify">I didn’t like what I was doing as I don’t see myself working on the .NET ecosystem in the future. I saw it as a walled garden. I wanted to work on open source tech as it opens more opportunities. As an example, a friend of mine had just recently started working abroad as a Software Engineer in Google. He landed that job because he focused on JavaScript and contributed to open source projects. Barely 5 years in the industry and now banking nearly a million pesos a month. Aside from that, if I were to use the .NET environment to build my SaaS startup on, I would need to have a bigger nest of capital if I were to plan on scaling.</p>

<p align="justify">I was spending my days coding at work on the weekdays, coming home at night to come back at learning more code to improve myself at a job that I do not want, and then on weekends you could see me coding again – but this time, I was working on my side projects. My work became my hobby. It was bad. I began to hate coding. There was no sense to what I was doing.</p>

<p align="justify">His answer was simple: “Why not just focus one thing at a time and learn enough to survive?”</p>

<p align="justify">It hit me like a brick. Looking at work as a learning experience, and that it’s okay to fail at times and ask a ton of questions. I reflected on it and indeed I realized that I was not asking more questions. I was struggling because of my ego. I began to start asking more questions, saying to myself that it’s okay and it doesn’t make me any less of a developer. The difference was night and day. I began finishing my work earlier. At night, I no longer have to spend my free time studying for work, I was free to work on my side projects and preparing for grad school. During my day, I had a lot of free time to study other skills and monitor my portfolio of investments, analyzing stocks and cryptocurrencies. I was not just gaining back my time, I was also earning more money and improving my relationship with my coworkers. I began to share more and break out from my shell. I began to see every task as a learning experience. </p>

<p align="justify">August was spent working on databases, making complex queries and stored procedures, and writing down the MVCs to connect it to the application. I had a direction. From my talks with my new found colleagues, I began to understand how even though I would not be continuing this career path, the things that I will learn here will branch out to my other endeavors. I have put myself in a position where I would gain from my work, and that has made all the difference.</p>

> Lessons Learned

<b>1.	Always treat everything as a learning experience and not as a competition. </b>
<p align="justify">I have always been competitive, and so I was frustrated when some of the interns whom I had started with (not from APC), began to progress faster than I did. These people were asking questions every 20 minutes or so. Initially, I found it amusing and would sometimes laugh at them mentally whenever they would ask trivial questions. But as the weeks came by, I saw that they were slowly becoming adept to their work It was when I followed suit and started asking more questions when I had progressed exponentially and started submitting my deliverables early. It is one thing to debug an issue on your own, and then it is another thing to debug an issue while also receiving some pearly wisdom from the veterans.</p>

<b>2.	Never eat alone.</b>
<p align="justify">I think that the best way to cultivate relationship with your coworkers, is to go to lunch with them. I’m more of an introvert so socializing sometimes seems more like a chore for me. But having lunch with somebody, even if you only talk a few sentences, snowballs into a healthy relationship. It is the cheapest way to socialize and build a network, you spend nothing except for your needs and it feels natural.</p>

<b>3.	Sharpen the saw.</b> 
<p align="justify">In my work, it is important to familiarize oneself with the ecosystem of Microsoft development: ASP.NET, C#, T-SQL and aside from those, one must also learn AngularJS and JavaScript. This free online course is what I used to grasp the basics of it: codeschool - AngularJS. Another one is an article: Ultimate guide to learning AngularJS in one day. I've always heard that JavaScript would be among the programming language of the future and will be seen everywhere from mobile to desktop - they were not kidding. </p>

<p align="justify">I have always focused on learning Python and Java, both of which I used for my thesis and schoolwork, especially Java since it is the Lingua Franca of the school’s Computer Science curriculum. It was only when I was in my third week of internship when I learned the value of becoming adept in web development. After all, that’s where everything is moving to. It was then important for me to familiarize myself with it, and so I utilized my student e-mail from Asia Pacific College to acquire a dreamspark account to access pluralsight for free. Pluralsight (https://www.pluralsight.com/) is an online education company that specializes in churning out courses for developers. Aside from that, I spent my weekends doing challenges and projects on freeCodeCamp ( https://www.freecodecamp.org/), a program that teaches you full stack JavaScript. </p>

<b>4.	Have a vision.</b>
<p align="justify">Having a firm vision, affected the way I stand, walk, and take action. A man without a vision is always letting the world push him around. He who does not have a vision, goes with the flow, and gets easily satisfied or accepts the circumstances. A man with a vision stands tall when faced with obstacles and positions himself so that he either gains or learns from his risks. Without a firm vision, a man will heed into the obstacles of life and shan’t take a risk for something he believes in.</p>

<p align="justify">It has been advantageous for me to have something to look forward to whenever I am putting in the hours on my job. After all, it is hard to spend your time grinding, when you don’t what it is for! Being confident with my vision has allowed me to share my most candid ideas, and thus became a better asset to the team. It made me more hungry, and competitive. Thus, I always look for improvement, whether that be in investing, coding, or with the way I interact with people.</p>
