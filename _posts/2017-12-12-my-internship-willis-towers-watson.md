<p align="justify">Everything that I have learned from the first half of my internship, INTERN2 is merely just a solidification of those lessons. </p>
<p align="justify">I would like to thank the following whom I had great exposure with:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sir Mark:</strong> for forcing me to face my SQL/Database “phobia”. And for also making me realise that although I do not like working with .NET, there are still some gems worth mining - and this goes for everything that we do in life.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Mike:</strong> for all those talks about programming and investing. Thank you for all those talks about jQuery and advice on how to improve oneself.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Leo:</strong> from all those talks and meetings, he gave me a mental framework on facing problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Abdel:</strong> for teaching me about deadpan humor, and also a thing or two about JavaScript debugging.</li>
