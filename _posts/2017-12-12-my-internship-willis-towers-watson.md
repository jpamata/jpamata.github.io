<p align="justify">Everything that I have learned from the first half of my internship, INTERN2 is merely just a solidification of those lessons. </p>
<p align="justify">I would like to thank the following whom I had great exposure with:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sir Mark:</strong> for forcing me to face my SQL/Database “phobia”. And for also making me realise that although I do not like working with .NET, there are still some gems worth mining - and this goes for everything that we do in life.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Mike:</strong> for all those talks about programming and investing. Thank you for all those talks about jQuery and advice on how to improve oneself.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Leo:</strong> from all those talks and meetings, he gave me a mental framework on facing problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Abdel:</strong> for teaching me about deadpan humor, and also a thing or two about JavaScript debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Sir Matt:</strong> for exposing me to Design Patterns and to not shy away from asking questions. Because you should always be humble because you do not know everything, and at the same time you must also be confident, because you can know anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Kels:</strong> for showing me how to make a documentation and how to turn over a project.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Rommel:</strong> for making me appreciate corporate work. You Sir, just have this habit of making tasks worth enjoyable, and making it seem like every task is built on a definite purpose. </li>
  <li><strong>Sir Sean:</strong> for those talks on tech and career. Though that day may have eclipsed your memory, I will never forget that time when you talked to me about what it's like in the industry as a senior developer.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Emil:</strong> for that 1 on 1 talk about a career on the tech industry and project management.</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Roland:</strong> for insights on the industry. I will miss the talks about</li>
  <li><strong>Sir Darwin:</strong> for giving me solid tips for the job hunt. </li>
  <li><strong>Miss Jeania:</strong> for helping me cultivate the habit of looking for problems to solve.</li>
  <li><strong>Miss Lui:</strong> for teaching me that the best way to vibe with a person, is through self-disclosure.</li>
  <li><strong>Miss April:</strong> for showing me how to arrange team events.</li>
  <li><strong>Miss Amy and Analyn:</strong> for showing me what enterprise management looks like.</li>
  <li><strong>Miss Daiz:</strong> for showing me solid project management and through my observation of how she worked, gave me a few business ideas.</li>
  <li>And of course, there are more people in the team who I had the pleasure of working with, and to these people, I say my warmest thanks. Thank you for making my time at Willis Towers Watson memorable.</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">With all of these said, perhaps the best thing that I got from my internship was this:</p>
<p align="justify">During my first week at Willis Towers Watson, they sent me to attend meetings on every team and every project that they have. They asked me to look at problems. And all those tasks given to me, the aggregate sum of it all, to these I give my greatest thanks. For ever since that week, I looked at problems differently.</p>

<p align="justify">Thank you for that. For what Descartes was to Newton, what Talmey was to Einstein, and what Gates was to Zuckerberg, if I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of these giants.</p>
