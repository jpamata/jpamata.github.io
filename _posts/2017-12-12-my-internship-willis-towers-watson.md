<p align="justify">Everything that I have learned in internship 2, is merely just a solidification of those lessons from my first internship. As my internship is nearing its end, in this post, I would like to thank the following whom I had the privilege of being with:</p>
<!-- more -->  
<ol>
  <li><strong>Mark:</strong> for forcing me to face my SQL/Database “phobia”. And for also making me realise that although I do not like working with .NET, there are still some gems worth mining - and this goes for everything that we do in life.</li>
  <li><strong>Mike:</strong> for all those talks about programming and investing. Thank you for all those talks about jQuery and advice on how to improve oneself.</li>
  <li><strong>Leo:</strong> from all those talks and meetings, he gave me a mental framework on facing problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Abdel:</strong> for teaching me about deadpan humor, and also a thing or two about JavaScript debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Matt:</strong> for exposing me to Design Patterns and to not shy away from asking questions. Because you should always be humble because you do not know everything, and at the same time you must also be confident, because you can know anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Kels:</strong> for showing me how to make a documentation and how to turn over a project.</li>
  <li><strong>Rommel:</strong> for making me appreciate corporate work. You Sir, just have this habit of making tasks worth enjoyable, and making it seem like every task is built on a definite purpose. </li>
  <li><strong>Sean:</strong> for those talks on tech and career. Though that day may have eclipsed your memory, I will never forget that time when you talked to me about what it's like in the industry as a senior developer.</li>
  <li><strong>Emil:</strong> for that 1 on 1 talk about a career on the tech industry and project management.</li>
  <li><strong>Roland:</strong> for insights on the industry. Aside from the jokes that you crack up in the middle of the day, I will miss the talks about job hunting, your past experiences with other project managers and your opinion on what defines a good leader.</li>
  <li><strong>Darwin:</strong> for giving me solid tips for the job hunt. </li>
  <li><strong>Jeania:</strong> for helping me cultivate the habit of looking for problems to solve.</li>
  <li><strong>Lui:</strong> for teaching me that the best way to vibe with a person, is through self-disclosure.</li>
  <li><strong>April:</strong> for showing me how to arrange team events.</li>
  <li><strong>Amy and Analyn:</strong> for showing me what enterprise management looks like.</li>
  <li><strong>Daiz:</strong> for showing me solid project management and through my observation of how she worked, gave me a few business ideas.</li>
  <li>And of course, there are more people in the team who I had the pleasure of working with, and to these people, I say my warmest thanks. Thank you for making my time at Willis Towers Watson memorable.</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">With all of these said, perhaps the best thing that I got from my internship was this:</p>
<p align="justify">During my first week at Willis Towers Watson, they sent me to attend meetings on every team and every project that they have. They asked me to look at problems. And all those tasks given to me, the aggregate sum of it all, to these I give my greatest thanks. For ever since that week, I looked at problems differently.</p>

<p align="justify">Thank you for that. For what Descartes was to Newton, what Talmey was to Einstein, and what Gates was to Zuckerberg, if I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of these giants.</p>

<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">It's been great fun to intern at Willis Towers Watson, they really treat their workers well. Aside from acquiring tools and pieces of knowledge that I would use to further my career, I had a blast with the team.</p>
