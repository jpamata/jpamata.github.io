```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, Internship")
}
```

<p align="justify">I started my internship on May 4, a Thursday. For the first week (May 4 & 5), it was mostly spent on getting to grasp the company and its projects. They showed me this vantage page where I filled up some personal details and went through a few online courses about the company. I also attended a couple meetings about the company's projects.</p>

> The Work

<p align="justify">During my internship interview, I had gotten the idea of what the company is and what it asks of its interns - .NET Development. So as what one sane person would've done, I studied some bit of the .NET world for the upcoming work. Unfortunately, all the time spent on studying were not enough to prepare me for the work ahead. Why? Because the projects were cluster bombs of different tech and libraries jumbled into an ASP.NET solution. </p>

<p align="justify">They also have this VBA training program, which I think is a brilliant opportunity for interns but frankly, I am yet to attend a single meeting seeing that I wasn't there when they began the training. For the past couple of weeks, I've went thru dozens of meetings about the onboardings, the projects, and a few meetings to discuss the team metrics. I've also done some JQuery to scrape up the data for application testing as my first real work.</p>

<p align="justify">For the next work, I was given the task to debug a code issue on how the excel output for a report from the web app is having some problems with rendering the values. I spent I think a couple of days or so before I realised that the problem was with the language type, that the app doesn't accept such values.</p> 

<p align="justify">It was frustrating at first because I had absolutely no idea on how to approach the problem. I went through method by method then line by line of the code (commenting out some lines or editing some values) to see on which part of the code results to the issue. I was like a blind man groping for the door handle. Nevertheless, that experience taught me how to read error reports from Visual Studio to diagnose the problem.</p>


<p align="justify">Aside from learning the ecosystem of Microsoft, one must also learn AngularJS and JavaScript. This free online course is what I used to grasp the basics of it: <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs">codeschool - AngularJS</a>. </p>

<p align="justify">This article also helped: <a href="https://toddmotto.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-angular-js-in-one-day/">Ultimate guide to learning AngularJS in one day</a>. I've always heard that JavaScript would be among the programming language of the future and will be seen everywhere from mobile to desktop - they were not kidding.</p>

<p align="justify">The team executes well. They follow the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile">Agile approach to Software Development</a> and they do all the agile ceremonies: tasks are given at the beginning of a sprint (2 weeks long), daily standup meetings to make a quick report of our status, iteration reviews and retros (retrospective/reflection) at the end of a sprint, and sprint plannings.</p>

> My Average Workday

<div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hK8Pvfw.png" align="center"></div>

<p align = "center"> *AM* </p>

**[5:00]** Alarm goes off

**[6:00]** Finally wake up. Read a book, typically memoirs and self-improvement books.

**[7:00]** Get out of bed, eat breakfast, bath, brush teeth. If I still don't feel like it, I play piano or browse the net.

**[8:10-30]** Arrive at the office

**[8:45]** Open ycombinator (hacker news) to read up the latest articles on business and tech.

**[9:00]** Panic as I start looking at yesterday's work to prepare a good report for our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting">daily standup meeting</a>. 

**[9:30]** The daily pilgrimage to the nearby Mcdonald's. I don't actually need to eat, but that routine serves as my "morning coffee".

**[10:00]** Normally, the standup meeting is scheduled around this hour. Around this time I get some tasks & then I'd add them to my to-do app. Thereafter, I'd research ways on how to solve that task and make a plan of action.

**[11:00]** The team goes out for lunch.

<p align= "center"> *PM* </p>

**[12:00]** This is when I start executing my plan of action, whether that be coding, hacking around the project, or learning the technologies required.

**[1:05]** Briefly consider a career change.

**[1:10]** Remember how much $$$ I'll be banking from a career/business in Tech, and that software development is fulfilling on its own :)

**[2:00]** For 5-10 mins, I either get out for a quick snack or a walk to stretch my back.

**[3:00]** Team usually  goes out to have a snack. Either that or there is a meeting. On the occassions that there's none of both, this is when I put my headphones on, play a song on repeat mode, and thereafter I'd transcend into deep work status.

**[3:30]** Receive a company e-mail about how much money "we" are making.

**[4:15]** Productivity breaks down and I start browsing the net every few minutes or so. I start asking my seniors for help if I'm not done yet with my task.

**[4:45]** I've probably read every post on the first 5 pages of hacker news and the Philippines subreddit.

**[5:30]** Elvis has left the building.

**[6:10-30]** If I arrived at work later than usual, this is the time I'd leave for home.

**[7:00]** Dine and long showers for retrospection. Calling up some friends, the usual cool down.

**[8:00]** Either read a STEM book (I buy too much O'Reilly books for my own good) or learn some new stuff from online.

**[10:00]** Sleep. If I can't sleep, I read a fiction book to put me to sleep.
