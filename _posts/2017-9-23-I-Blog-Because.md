 #...I'm not an expert.
 
<p align="justify">I admit it. I am not an expert and I do not claim to be one. How can I? I'm just an undergrad who hasn't gotten a glimpse yet of the industry; I haven't put in as much time as others had. Whenever I talk to people about putting their content out there, their voice on the matter, they would often tell me of not being good enough:</p>
 
 <center>
 
 <p>"Why would they listen to me?"</p>
 
 <p>"What can I share that is worth reading?"</p>
 
 <p>But here's the thing:</p>
 
 </center>
 
 > You do not have to be an expert
 
 <p align="justify">I do not believe that you have to be an expert nor be the very best in your field to blog and share your lessons. After all, how can you be so sure that you're the top dog in your field? There will always be someone who's more knowledgeable - that's the hard truth. At the same time, the inverse is also true: there will always be someone out there who knows less than you. You do not have to be an expert to have a voice because chances are, there are people out there who find yours valuable. </p>
 
 <p align="justify">Still, there will be those saying that they don't have anything of value to share. Here's a solution:</p>
 
 <p align="justify">When thinking of the question <strong>"What can I share?"</strong>, think in terms of <strong>"What do I know?"</strong> instead of <strong>"What unique knowledge do I know?"</strong></p>
 
 > Blogging improves your understanding
 
 <p align="justify">Learning is about doing and reflection. Blogging is the perfect platform for that. The very act of writing the content itself, is reinforcing what you know. I find questions, research, answer, and reflect. Or somebody corrects me and does it all for me. Research, write, publish, stay hungry, learn more, and repeat. That's what it's all about.</p>
 
 > Blogging is a complement to your journey
 
 <p align="justify">Knowing that someone out there might be reading my articles is enough of an excuse for me to continually accept criticisms and reach out for any corrections. It is humbling. It also forces me to stay updated with the trend. It forces one to think in ways we don't normally do. And if anyone's not reading my articles, I do not worry. As far as I'm concerned - I have one. Myself. In the end, this is a journal of my discoveries, of my thoughts, and reflections. Even if nobody reads your blog, it still has an intrinsic value: it is your knowledgebase of thoughts.</p>
 
 > Blogging extends my network
 
 <p align="justify">Aside from this blog, I have a personal blog that I regularly update and through that blog I have expanded my circle of friends. I can't remember how much I've used that blog as an excuse to be friends with a taxi driver, a colleague or a beautiful model. Way too much that I have also used it to improve my relationship with my friends - simply because I can recall the times we've had and share or give a different take on that experience again.</p>
 
 > Don't be so gentle
 
 <p align="justify">So whatever mistakes or any foolish piece of writing I publish, don't be so gentle. Tell me I'm wrong, point out my mistakes, and help me learn. Let's learn together.</p>
 
 <p align="justify">That's why I blog, because I'm not an expert - and making a journal of my mistakes and lessons, sharing my failures to others, and learning alongside people about these mistakes will help me get there. </p>
 
 #I blog because I'm not an expert, and this will help me get there.
