<p align="justify">I'm taking a break for a month to focus on some projects of mine.</p>

<p align="justify">The following is an entry from my journal for 2020-08-30, it was among the last straws that broke the camel's back. I read a few posts that were clearly wrong and wanted to educate people about it, but later after I had written my draft to it and was now about to comment it out (well, a series of comments), I looked at the clocked. I wasted an hour just to prove someone was wrong. I dont recall what the topic was about, I think it was something about distributed systems, I forgot about it now. But I ended up not typing it out into facebook. That was when I stopped using facebook, for now.</p>

<p align="justify">So I decided to download everything I need for my goals (such as ripping off hundreds of math videos related to my math studies - mostly Wildberger - at YouTube) and blocking off sites as well as ways to contact me both online and in real life. It's hermit mode.
</p>

<p align="justify">I'm not really turning the internet off, I'll still be using it. But only GitHub, stackexchange, teamblind (for Leetcode entertainment), leetcode, and blogger will be the ones I'm using. Everything else is blocked.</p>

<p align="justify">I still need facebook and other social/messaging apps like email & messenger, unlike those uber geeks at Hacker News who probably dont have much friends anyway lol. ðŸ˜‚  So I'll come back in a while when everything else is balanced. </p>

<p align="justify">I noticed that I rarely use social media (aside from messaging like messenger & google email), hacker news, 4chan, programming education platforms such as udemy/pluralsight/youtube and other focus blackholes anyway when I'm fine with my goals. </p>

<p align="justify">I just set out too many goals to accomplish by October, so it's my fault that this happened. For example, before I made a "1-Year CS Curriculum" to get me better at grad school research, the average daily total time I use social media was 0-5 minutes a day and for Hacker News was about 10-20 minutes a day.</p>

<p align="justify">My usage of them scales up only when I'm stressed and need a quick escape.  So this month of unplugging will do that. But nonetheless, it gave me a challenge to conquer.</p>

<p align="justify">Thus I made my last social media post in a while, posting it when everyone else was asleep. Saves me the time from telling each of my friends that I'm unplugged. Granted, I posted it on instagram, a platform that most of my friends barely use. Still, it's better than nothing.</p>

<p align="justify">Let the grind begin</p>
