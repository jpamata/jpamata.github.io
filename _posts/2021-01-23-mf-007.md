There isnt anything of note in the lecture that warrants me writing a blog post for it that I can review later (which is the purpose of this series). Nonetheless... 

<!-- more -->  

I think that the lecture is worth a watch especially as Wildberger explains the intuition for borrowing in subtraction, showing multiplication in terms of powers such as the following:

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dzYyT21GB8OA3lZGc2o4HlFelCt0LwJ-_B0EWRhsG3hz4T19wjJUym5hGADPX8kXowSH-yfONwK7PNlB-cau1EHPaolRIPD21OzxAegj4jJJXZPr5MWVtAGi9bvCkg0IhgaXXyBg9pXuWASHMbTGlV=w932-h816-no?authuser=0">

It shows that the distributive law is what is really happenning in multiplication, as well as he explains why we are doing it. By now it should've been intuitive or seemed common sense to us, but when I was a kid I was never taught this way. I was just taught mechanically, "do this and that, carry it here and add, dont ask why" kind of style.

I highly recommend watching it for kids.
