<p>Wildberger calls it the trickiest operation.</p>

<p>Division is merely repeated subtraction, and is why the symbol for division \(\div\) resembles the symbol for subtraction -</p>

<!-- more --> 

<p>For example, 30 \(\div\) 5 = 6 or \(\frac{30}{5}\) = 6, shown below</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #ea9999;">| | | | |</span>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: orange;">&nbsp;| | | | |&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: yellow;">| | | | |</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: lime;">| | | | |</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #b6d7a8;">| | | | |</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #d5a6bd;">| | | | |</span></p>

<p>We subtract groups of 5 strokes/lines, repeating this until we've exhausted everything and arrived with 6 groups of 5.</p>
<p>m divided by n equals to k means that m is equal to k groups of n or m is equal to k times n</p>
<p>\(\frac{m}{n}\) = k or m \(\div\) n = k \(\leftrightarrow\) m = k \(\times\) n</p>

<center>
<p>Here are the 4 laws of division</p>
<p>\(\frac{k}{m}\) + \(\frac{n}{m}\) = \(\frac{k + n}{m}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{k}{m}\) \(\cdot\) \(\frac{n}{l}\) = \(\frac{kn}{ml}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{k/m}{n}\) = \(\frac{k}{mn}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{k}{m/n}\) = \(\frac{kn}{m}\)</p>
</center>

<p>Perhaps I'll edit this post later to add more, the proofs and an example of long division. We'll see when I have the time for it and recall about this.</p>
