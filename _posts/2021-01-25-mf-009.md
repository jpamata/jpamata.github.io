<p>To review, a natural number is a mathematical object of  type <u>Num</u> (standing for natural number). A few operations we can do with numbers are</p>

<p>s(Num) = Num</p>
<p>Num + Num = Num</p>
<p>Num \(\times\) Num = Num</p>
<p>A fraction is a new mathematical object.  The following are a few ways of illustrating fractions:</p>

<p>For our main definition:</p>
<p>A fraction is an ordered pair (m,n) of natural numbers also written in m/n.</p>
<p>If we have two fractions, m/n and  k\(\ell\) are equal \(\Leftrightarrow\) m\(\ell\) = nk</p>
<p>For example: 2/3 = 6/9 = 4/6</p>
<p>Wildberger's lectures, at least from this point coming from natural numbers, go with representing fraction with a slanted line, and division iwth a horizontal.</p>
<p>15/5 is a fraction, of type <u>Fra</u></p>
<p>\(\frac{15}{5}\) is a number, of type <u>Num</u></p>
