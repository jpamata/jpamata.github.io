To review:

<p>Num or Natural Numbers: I, II, III, ...</p>

<p>Fra or Fractions: m/n where m, n, \(\in\) Num</p>

<p>\(\in\) this symbol means "are" or "is" according to wildberger. But I believe that to be specific, the symbol means "is an element of"</p>

<p>Fractions also have a notion of equality, and this happens when</p>

<p>m/n =  k\(\ell\) \(\Leftrightarrow\) m\(\ell\) = nk</p>

<p>With the given notion of equality, we are left with a question:</p>
<!-- more --> 

<p><u>Does m/n =  k\(\ell\)  and k\(\ell\) = p/q imply m/n = p/q?</u></p>
