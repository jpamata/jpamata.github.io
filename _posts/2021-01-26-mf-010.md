To review:

Num or Natural Numbers: I, II, III, ...

Fra or Fractions: m/n where m, n, \(\in\) Num

\(\in\) this symbol means "are" or "is" according to wildberger. But I believe that to be specific, the symbol means "is an element of"

Fractions also have a notion of equality, and this happens when

m/n =  k\(\ell\) \(\Leftrightarrow\) m\(\ell\) = nk

With the given notion of equality, we are left with a question:
<!-- more --> 

Does m/n =  k\(\ell\)  and k\(\ell\) = p/q imply m/n = p/q?
