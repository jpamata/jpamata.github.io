<p>In this lesson, we get introduced to rational numbers. The first and most important example of what in mathematics is called a field, to which Wildberger claims is the most important field in mathematics.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Field:  a domain which we can do addition, multiplication, subtraction and division in a complete and consistent way.</p>

<h2>So far, we have started from </h2>
<p>Natural Numbers (Num) and from there we were introduced into Fractions (Fra) through the concept of division</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Num: 1, 2, 3</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Fra: 2/3 (read as 2 over 3), 3/1 (read as 3 over 1)</p>

<p>Then from Num, we were introduced to Integers (Int) through the concept of subtraction. This was our previous lesson.</p>

<p><big>➤</big> Num: 1, 2, 3</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Int: 1 \ 2 (read as 1 less 2),  3 \ 1 (read as 3 less 1)</p>

<p>Now we want to go from Int to Rational Numbers (Rat) the same way we were introduced into Fra from Num - augmenting integers with division.</p>

<p><big>➤</big> Int: 1 \ 2 (read as 1 less 2),  3 \ 1 (read as 3 less 1)</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Rat: (1 \ 2) / (3 \ 1)</p>

<h2>Official definition of Rational Number (illustrated as Rat)</h2>

<p>A rational number is an ordered pair (a, b)  where a,b \(\in\) Int, b \(\ne\) 0 </p>

<p><big>➤</big> a,b \(\in\) Int, b \(\ne\) 0 </p>
<p> this is read as read as "a and b are integers and b is not equal to zero"</p>
<p> a,b \(\in\) Int: read as a and b are integers</p>
<p> b \(\ne\) 0 : read as b is not equal to zero</p>
<p>we write ordered pair (a, b) as a/b (read as a over b)</p>

<p><big>➤</big> what is zero? It's a special integer. It's the integer 1 less 1 or 2 less 2, etc or basically
<p>[ 0 \(\equiv\) 1 \ 1]</p>
<p>\(\equiv\) means "equivalent" or "defined as"</p>

<p><big>➤</big> There's also an important notion of equality</p>
<p>a/b = c/d \(\Leftrightarrow\) ad = bc</p>
<p>The above is read as a over b is equal to c over d precisely when ad is equal to bc</P>
<p>Wildberger reads \(\Leftrightarrow\)  as "precisely when." The symbol is used for definitions.</p>

<p>Now let's introduce some notation to make rational numbers look more familiar</p>

<h2>Let's start with Integers (Int) notation</h2>

<p><big>➤</big> 1 \ 2 \(\equiv\) -1</p>
<p>The integer 1 less 2 is written as -1, minus 1.</p>
<p><big>➤</big> 3 \ 1 \(\equiv\) 2</p>
<p>The integer 3 less 1 is written as 2</p>

<p><big>➤</big> Let's explain what the image says.</p>
<p>If we have m less n then there are 3 possibilities</p>
<p>if m is bigger than n or if m>n we will write it as m-n (m minus n)</p>
<p>if n is bigger than m or if n>m, then we get what is called a negative number. We write it as -(n-m)</p>
<p>if m and n are equal or if m=n, then we use the symbol 0 or zero.</p>

<h2>Now let's go with talking about the notation for Rational Numbers (Rat)</h2>

<p><big>➤</big> (1 \ 2) / (3 \ 1) \(\equiv\) -1/2</p>
<p>As we can recall from our section on integer notation, we expressed 1 less 2 (1 \ 2) as -1, a more familiar term.</p>
<p>Then we can read the following expression as 1 less 2 over 3 less 1 can be expressed as minus 1 over 2</p>

<p><big>➤</big> Other examples</p>
<p>3/1 \(\equiv\) 3</p>
<p>3 over 1 is abbreviated as 3 </p>
<p>0/1 \(\equiv\) 0</p>
<p>0 over 1 is abbreviated as 0</p>
<p>1/1 \(\equiv\) 1</p>

<h2>Now we define the main operations for rational numbers</h2>

<p><big>➤</big> Addition</p>
<p>a/b + c/d \(\equiv\)  (ad + bc) / bd</p>
<p>if we have a over b and c over d then we define it with the familiar form for fractions</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Multiplication</p>
<p>(a/b) \(\times\) (c/d) \(\equiv\) (ac)/(bd)</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Subtraction</p>
<p>a/b - c/d \(\equiv\)  (ad-bc)/bd</p>
<p>just like addition</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Divison</p>
<p>(a/b) \(\div\) (c/d) = \(\frac{a/b}{c/d}\) \(\equiv\)  (ad)/(bc)
<p>just the inverse of subtraction</p>
<p>Note that in these operations, the denominator cannot be zero as division by zero is not allowed.</p>



<h2>Rational numbers are a field</h2>
<p><big>➤</big> (Rat, t, x) is a field</p>
<p>read as Rational numbers, together with the operations addition and multiplication, forma. field.</p>
<p><big>➤</big> "So what does it mean? It means that various laws are satisfied."</p>

<h2>Here are some laws:</h2>

<p><big>➤</big> Associative law</p>
<p>(p + q) + r = p + (q + r)</p>
<p>(p \(\times\) q) \(\times\) r = p \(\times\) (q \(\times\) r)</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Commutative law</p>
<p>p + q = q + p</p>
<p>p \(\times\) q = q \(\times\) p</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Special elements </p>
<p>We have 3 special elements: 0, 1, -1</p>
<p>These 3 special elements have the following properties:</p>
<p>O + p = p</p>
<p>zero is an additive</p>
<p>l \(\times\) p = p</p>
<p>1 is a multiplicative identity</p>
<p>1 + (-1) = 0</p>
<p><big>➤</big> Inverse property: if p \(\ne\) 0 then there is q \(\equiv\) p\(^{-1}\)  such that pq = 1</p>
<p>Read as if you have any element p that is not zero, then there should be another element, q, sometimes denoted as p to the minus 1 that has the property that p times q equals 1.</p>
<p>Meaning that every element p has an inverse that when you multiplied it to, you get 1.</p>
<p>NOTE for safari browsers: the p\(^{-1}\)  is p^-1, the mathjax just sucks at rendering it in safari browser. In Chrome mathjax/latex renders well. </p>
<p><big>➤</big> Distributive law or the law that connects multiplication and addition.</p>
<p>p \(\times\) (q + r) = p \(\times\) q + p \(\times\) r</p>

<p>In the next lesson, we look at visualising rational numbers and connect it to ford circles.
