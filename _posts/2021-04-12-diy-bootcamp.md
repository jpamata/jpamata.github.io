Alright, time for a new project: I've decided to learn programming seriously from this month til the end of August 2021, which translates <u>roughly to 140 days of learning</u>. And I'm going to blog everyday what I learned from learning web development.

The tag I created for this series is: <a href="/tags#diy-bootcamp">diy-bootcamp</a>

<strong>⤐ "imma teach myself"</strong>

I know that the "i'm gonna teach myself programming" phrase is made fun of all the time. The usual reasoning is that  software engineers are teaching themselves things all the time anyway and you can even argue it's the same for every profession if you have the time for it, but I'm still putting that in the title. Especially as for the past few months, I was contemplating of attending something like a coding bootcamp or some other formal training to review some programmming knowhow.

<strong>⤐ the why</strong>

I've long known that I suck at things like web development, I didnt bother to look at the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I just did the typical trial and error route. I also havent programmed seriously in a while. And now I'm looking to get back into the industry somewhere around the later parts of 2021 as I've revived my programming interest after having done some bits of programming last year and seeing several live streams of a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzFUMGbVxlQs5s-LNAyKgcq5SL28ZLLKC">lively software engineer</a> spending his weekends hacking into some random topic he's learning.

<strong>⤐ So what's this DIY Programming Bootcamp like?</strong>

So what's the plan? For now, I dont know. Sounds pathetic to hear but I guess I'll just do what I feel like doing. All I know is that I'm interested to spend the next 140 days on the following

- really learning HTML,CSS, and JS basics

- learn some computer science basics

- learn a bit about computers and systems

- learn about basic networks knowledge for webdev

- maybe create a game, even simple ones will do, but there's probably a lot of repetitive work here

- recreate clones of popular apps, maybe social networks or an ecommerce app

- maybe dip my toes into either machine learning, deep learning, or data science

- picking up meme JS frameworks and libraries like react, angular, or play with some graphics library

- maybe build some good projects that'd look good for a webdev  portfolio

We'll just wing it from here.

<strong>⤐ blog series format</strong>

Initially I thought of making this a series like a programming tutorial or book unfolding, where we explore deeply the things I've learned each day. But But I realised that it's going to take a lot of time to do so. I usually measure my focus sessions using [toggl](https://toggl.com/), an easy time tracking software. I started writing a draft for a blog post about HTML and CSS and what I've learned so far, which is just some basic tier knowhow, and according to toggl it took me 8 hours. And I havent even finished it yet. All for a post that's probably just a 5-10 minute read in the end.

Thus, I've decided to make this series of blog posts really basic and minimal. A summary of what I did that day as well as if possible, some short lessons of what I learned that day -- or at least those I feel like are worth reviewing later. Perhaps later I can revisit the posts, polish it so it wont look trash and perhaps add some more details so it at least provides worthwhile educational value. Though what's probably more likely to happen in the future is for me to take something I've written in this series and then make a more detailed, separate post for it.

<strong>⤐ blogging everyday</strong>

Yeah it's a hard challenge, since writing a draft post alone takes some time especially if youre not used to blogging like me. This post alone took me more than an hour to think and write about. 

Life also happens. We get lazy, or have to do something else and it (oftentimes uxpectedly) takes up a lot of our time. But I will still blog about those lazy days. You may see some blog posts in this series about days where I didnt do much but relax or days where I pretty much just struggled. This series then is likely not worth reading. But I don't care, this blog is primarily for myself anyway. Something that helps me reflect on wtf I'm doing with my life

<strong>⤐ so 140 days, really?</strong>

Who knows? I might extend this program longer than that when I feel like it, or quit it early. Let's see.

so now... LEZGOOOO!!
