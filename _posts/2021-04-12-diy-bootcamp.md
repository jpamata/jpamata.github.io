Alright, time for a new project: I've decided to learn web development seriously from this month til the end of May, which translates <u>roughly to 49 days of learning</u>. And I'm going to blog everyday what I learned from learning web development.

The tag I created for this series is: <a href="/tags#diy-bootcamp-webdev">diy-bootcamp-webdev</a>

<strong>⤐ "imma teach myself"</strong>

I know that the "i'm gonna teach myself programming" phrase is made fun of all the time. The usual reasoning is that  software engineers are teaching themselves things all the time anyway and you can even argue it's the same for every profession if you have the time for it, but I'm still putting that in the title. Especially as for the past few months, I was contemplating of attending something like a bootcamp or some other formal training to learn some web development.

<strong>⤐ the why</strong>

I've long known that I suck at web development, I didnt bother to look at the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I just did the typical trial and error route. I also havent programmed seriously in a while. And now I'm looking to get back into the industry somewhere around the later parts of 2021 as I've revived my programming interest after having done some bits of programming last year and seeing several live streams of a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzFUMGbVxlQs5s-LNAyKgcq5SL28ZLLKC">lively software engineer</a> spending his weekends hacking into some random topic he's learning.

<strong>⤐ So what's my DIY bootcamp like?</strong>

I dont know. Sounds pathetic to hear but I guess I'll just do what I feel like doing. All I know is that I'm interested to spend the next 49 days on

- really learn HTML,CSS, and JS basics

- learn about basic networks knowledge for webdev

- maybe create a game, even simple ones will do, but there's probably a lot of repetitive work here

- recreate clones of popular apps, maybe social networks or an ecommerce app

- maybe dip my toes into either machine learning, deep learning, or data science

- picking up JS frameworks and libraries like react, angular, or some graphics library

- maybe build some good projects that'd look good for a webdev portfolio

<strong>⤐ blogging everyday</strong>

Yeah it's a hard challenge, since writing a draft post alone takes some time especially if youre not used to blogging like me. This post alone took me almost an hour to think and write about. 

Life also happens. We get lazy, or have to do something else and it (oftentimes uxpectedly) takes up a lot of our time. But I will still blog about those lazy days. You may see some blog posts in this series about days where I didnt do much but relax or days where I pretty much just struggled. These are likely not worth reading. But I don't care, this blog is primarily for myself anyway. Something that helps me reflect on wtf I'm doing with my life

so anyhow... LEZGOOOO!
