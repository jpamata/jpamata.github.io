Alright, time to get into the meme.

I started learning some python today, one thing that surprised me was that False, "", and 0 are considered as "False" in python

I used JetBrains Academy's Hyperskill to learn Python but at least on my end, it was a poor experience. I downloaded the IntelliJ Edu IDE for it as it's much faster sometimes to do the exercises. On most exercises, it takes MINUTES to check the code I submitted for the exercises. This one alone took 5 minutes of loading time from hyperskill just to check my answer

All that for an exercise that took me probably 20 seconds to read the problem description as well as code the answer. And youd have to do these again and again as you cant progress throughout the hyperskill curriculum  until you solve every exercise. 

So instead I just went ahead and experimented with things and looked for various blogs, videos, and books to spend my money on. I chosed to do courses from [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/all) as the ones that caught my eye aren't too handwavy, particularly things like [#100DaysOfCode in Python Course
](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_in_python/100-days-of-code-in-python) basing on the reviews and its content on the website. I especially like how it's just 17.4 hours of video lectures and most videos average 3 minutes. The entire course catalog from the site is just $299 so it's a no-brainer. Cheap and there's a multitude of ways to recuperate that money when needed and especially in online, there's many ways for passive income. Then I bookmarked several more articles and book links. Things that I'll do later.

With enough resources picked, I downloaded pycharm but as it turns out, I have to set up some interpreters for it and I'm too lazy to do that so I just fired up VS Code. Then as it turns out, VS Code has to download some extensions. Nope. I just need an editor that shows me some errors as I type. Just fired emacs and all is good. No setting up needed.

I just did some baby tier coding afterwards like this code below

```python
print("hello world! I am... wait....")

user_input = input("what's my name again? ")

output = 'hello world! I am ' + user_input

print(output)
```
 
Some pretty basic code, but for beginners those 4 lines of code introduces 5 things about python:

1. printing to the console with <code>print()</code>

2. introduction to the concept of functions

3. getting user input with  <code>input()</code> function

4. variables

5. giving  values from either literal or from functions

I didnt do much later... The bulk of my time was spent going through hyperskill and especially in having analysis paralysis of what to study for this DIY bootcamp.

Nonetheless, today has been a good day. 

My doggo agrees.
