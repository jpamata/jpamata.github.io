Still on a break from computers, I opened my macbook today as I couldnt reist the temptation. I just checked my mails and I had just read the an email from a well accomplished database professor. Earlier I emailed him for some advice on learning the internals and implementations of databases. He replied by giving me some resources as well as his book. I checked out his book and it's perfect. I'd like to talk about it, but it might attract some unintended attention and in turn, he'll start getting spam emails.

With this, I looked for some open source database projects I could work on in the future, and ones that caught my eye are cockroachDB and trinoDB. One is built in Go and the latter is built in Java.

I downloaded the code and created my own "toy repo" for it, then I looked into the codebase which is of course, HUGE. Couldnt understand a single thing. That's not MY problem though, that's my FUTURE ME's problem. Step by step, little by little, that's how we go. Learn some Java and GO first, then some databases, and google what I dont understand in the codebase. That's the plan.

After that, I didnt do much today. Still on that eye strain break. I'm thinking about 10 days of this break. My eyes get really itchy when staring on the screen, despite wearing glasses.

As usual, here's today's walk with doggo
