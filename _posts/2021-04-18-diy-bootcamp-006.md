For some tech related things, I decided to learn some C for now, as I got really interested to do some systems studies later as that is what I realised that is missing from my academic education as well as from coding bootcamp grads. I'm not really sure if I'll do my systems studies in C or in Go, but learning C definitely opens up lots of doors for learning resources.
