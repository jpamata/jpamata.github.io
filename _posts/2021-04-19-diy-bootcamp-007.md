Oh wow, it's already been a week since we started? I really need to take this seriously. Thus, despite my eye strain break thatll probably last for a week more, I did go back to learning programming today. Though only for a small bit as I still need to take care of my eyes.

<!-- more -->

As said in yesterday's post, I decided to go with C for now, leaving python in the dust for the moment. I chose to go through the book

I made a github repo for it to track my progress: [https://github.com/johnamata/tcpl2](https://github.com/johnamata/tcpl2)

# Notes

Mostly ones i took from the book itself

- The age of the book quickly shows itself as one gets the ff error when trying to compile the first program on the first chapter of the book 

    - <code>
hello.c:3:1: warning: type specifier missing, defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
main(){</code>

- compile with <code>$ cc program_name.c</code> and now this produces an executable

- run the executable with <code>$ ./executable_name.out</code>

- C programs contain <u>functions and variables</u>

- Function - contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done

- Variables - store values used during the computation

- <code>main</code> is a special function.  every program must have a main somewhere, program begins executing at the beginning of main. will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some that you wrote, and others from libraries that are provided for you. 

- ```# include <stdio.h>``` tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library

- code 1

```c
# include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

- One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called <u>arguments</u>, to the function it calls.

- Function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments like the ```printf()``` code

- A sequence of characters in double quotes, like ```"hello, world\n"```, is called a <u>character string</u> or <u>string constant</u>. ```\n``` is the <u>newline chracgter</u> which when printed, advances the output to the left margin on THE NEXT LINE. printf() needs a newline character in the end so we have to add it, see code 2...

- code 2: the following will produce same output as code 1

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
     printf("hello, ");
     printf("world");
     printf("\n");
}
```

other <u>escape sequences</u>: <code>\t</code> for Tab, <code>\b</code> for backspace, <code>\"</code> for double quote, <code>\\</code> for backslash 

That's enough for today. I realised I spent more time with this blog post than actually working on the book. Tomorrow, I might not write blog post notes for the moment and focus on going through the book. Perhaps I'll dedicate sundays and even saturdays for reediting blog posts made in the week to add notes to them. I havent even reedited Bootcamp Day 2's post to add notes for it yet. Let's finish backlogs this weekend. Hopefully by the time you've read this post, Bootcamp Day 2's post has been edited.


# Things to do

- read [The Practice of Programming (Kindle Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook/dp/B00HU50A12) by Kernighan and Pike
- read [The Art and Science of Doing Engineering (Kindle Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning-ebook/dp/B07CSX7TCM) by Richard Hamming
- read [The Object Oriented Thought Process (Ebook)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-object-oriented-thought/9780135182130/) by Matt Weisfeld
- read [Deep Work (Kindle Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM) by Cal Newport
- probably make a todo page on this website, that way I can remind myself quickly the things on my backlog

# More notes on Future of this blog series

It took me 40 minutes to write out the draft for this blog post, despite plenty of the notes pretty much taken word for word from the book. I wonder how long it would take for me to write out blog posts if I did otherwise. It's a pretty long time. Especially compared to the time it took me to go through the book and try out some code and do the exercises - which all took me like 10 minutes maybe. 

Making these blog posts have been a chore. Perhaps I'll stop writing about my notes outright and just write about what I did on each day. Then later I'll come back maybe a year later to polish the blog posts to add some notes.
