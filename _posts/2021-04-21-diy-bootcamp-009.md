Did nothing today. Went to the  mall to head to the eye doctor. Also did some window shopping and looked for some Math books. I thought that if my eye strain lasts long, I could probably just do some math books to keep myself productive. Anyhow, here's some pics from the trip.

The mall. Usually it's full of people, now it's almost empty. A year ago, this was really empty as heck.

Didnt find any math books, the bookstore here isnt selling any college textbooks. Must be because for the whole school year, all schools in the country (or perhaps not for the far flung areas) are doing online/distance education. Perhaps thatll continue til next year with the way things are going.
