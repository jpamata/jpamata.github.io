Did nothing today. Still on that eye strain break. I went out for 2nd opinion from a doctor for my eyes. Then I got some new prescription glasses at another mall (not the one from yesterday).

Check it out

The glasses are tinted brown kind of like gunnar glasses for blue light protection. Then there's a 2nd lens underneath it, again with antiradiation, albeit it's not tinted. One can remove the other lens if they want to. I personally won't. I dont want to get that eye strain again. The eye strain the past few days spooked me.

After not being able to find a math book yesterday from the other mall's bookstore, I tried my luck here, at a larger bookstore. Unfortunately they also dont have college textbooks thanks to education from primary school to college being online thanks to coronachan.

Men's room at the mall. I dont know why I decided to take a pic here, but at least there's a pic of me.
