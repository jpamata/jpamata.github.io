Still on an Eye Strain break so I cant really work more than 2 hours on the computer. Nonetheless, I did some Java. I began working through the book, [Thinking in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Java-4th-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486). They say it's a classic and focuses more on the design of Java, not really something for the beginner.

# Notes

Just pretty few. I didnt want to type much because of my eyes.

## Alan Kay's summary of smalltalk, the 1st OOP language of w/c Java is also  based on

- Everything is an object. Think of an object as a fancy variable; it stores data
- A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages.
- Each object has its own memory made up of other objects. 
- Every object has a type. 
- All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages. 

## object

- objects have state, behavior and identity.
- state: internal data that gives its state
- behaviour: methods produce behaviour
- identity: each object has a unique address in memory

Usually I end these posts with a walk with my dog. But I got lazy today. All I did was watch cobra kai the entire day. I loved it. Pretty motivating. The character is pretty based and it's like a story of (dragonball) Vegeta's redemption. I'm just about to finish season 1.
