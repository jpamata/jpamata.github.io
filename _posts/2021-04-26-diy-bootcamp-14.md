Didnt do a single thing today. I'm still having some eye strain but I'm getting better, so I should be doing stuff today but I didnt. I didnt have a plan. That's what I shouldve done, made a todo this morning or the night before. 

I just watched all Cobra Kai episodes so far. One of the best TV series I've watched man. Though I didnt like how some parts of it werent focused on Cobra Kai man himself and his sense Reese, which is my 2nd fave character in the series (writers did a good job), the final episodes of the season make up for it.

Waiting for season 4!

For now, as usual to end this post, a pic of my doggo from today's walk
