Today I continue doing How to Design Programs or [HtDP](https://htdp.org/). I talked about grinding through the book on yesterday's DIY Bootcamp post. I'm thinking that starting around May, I'll aim to do maybe about 5 exercises per day.

<!-- more -->

I did more than do HtDP today, but I feel like blogging about HTDP is easier than the others.

Now let's start.

To review, this is a primitive expression

```racket
(+ 420 69) ; outputs 489
```

You write one by starting with a <code>(</code> then you follow it with a primitive operation  which in this case is <code>+</code>. Then afterwards, separated by spaces, you write down the parameters and finally a closing <code>)</code>

Other operations for numbers include

+, -, *, /, abs, add1, ceiling, denomina- tor, exact->inexact, expt, floor, gcd, log, max, numerator, quo- tient, random, remainder, sqr, and tan. 

```racket
(+ 1 2 3 (+ 420 69)) ; output 495
```

In the above, we have 3 parameters, 1 of thoes parameter is an expression.

note: #i prefix means the number <u>is not preciese</u>

exercise 1: x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point. Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin, that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).


```racket
(define x 3)
(define y 4)

;; sqrt gets the square root
(define (cart i j)
  (sqrt(+ (* i i)
          (* j j))))

(cart x y)
```

exercise 2: string primitives to create an expression that concatenates pre- fix and suffix and adds "_" between them. 

```racket
(define prefix "hello")
(define suffix "world")

(string-append prefix "_" suffix)
```

some string arithmetics here. A string is a sequence of characters.

BSL includes only one operation that exclusively consumes and pro- duces strings: <code>string-append</code>. As we could see from the prologue chapter, or even at yesterday's post, it concatenates strings. Basically an operation like <code>+</code>

exercise 3:  create an expression using string primitives that adds "_" at position i. 

```racket
(define str "helloworld")
(define i 5)

(string-append (substring str 0 5) "_" (substring str 5))

;; substring format
; (substring str start [end]) → string?
; str : string?
; start : exact-nonnegative-integer?
; end : exact-nonnegative-integer? = (string-length str)
```

<code>string-length</code> consumes a string and produces a number

<code>string-ith</code> consumes a string s together with a number i and ex-tracts the 1String located at the ith position (counting from 0)

note: <u>1String</u> refers to the characters that make up a String. For example, "red" consists of three such 1Strings: "r", "e", "d".

<code>number->string</code> consumes a number and produces a string.

<code>substring</code> Returns a new mutable string that is (- end start) characters long, and that contains the same characters as str from start inclusive to end exclusive. The first position in a string corresponds to 0, so the start and end arguments must be less than or equal to the length of str, and end must be greater than or equal to start, otherwise the exn:fail:contract exception is raised.

exercise 4:  Use the same setup as in exercise 3 to create an expression that deletes the ith position from str.

```racket
(define str "helloworld")
(define i 5)
(string-append (substring str 0 (- i 1)) "_" (substring str i))
```

Just move end pointer of first subtring to the left.

exercise 5: Use the 2htdp/image library to create the image of a simple boat or tree. 

I chose to do a boat

Here's the code behind the drawing

```racket
(define OCEAN
  (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "sky blue"))

(define THESAIL    (add-line (right-triangle 36 48 "solid" "white")
                           0 0 0 60 "brown"))

(define BOATBOW    (ellipse 14 50 "solid" "sky blue"))
(define BOATBOTTOM (rectangle 100 35 "solid" "sky blue"))
(define BOATHULL   (rectangle 100 50 "solid" "brown"))

(define BOATBODY (overlay/align/offset "center" "bottom" BOATBOTTOM 0 0
   (overlay/align/offset "right" "center" BOATBOW -10 0 
                        (overlay/align/offset "left" "center" BOATBOW 10 0 BOATHULL))))

(define SIMPLEBOAT 
  (overlay/align/offset "center" "bottom" BOATBODY 15 -50 THESAIL))

(overlay SIMPLEBOAT OCEAN)
```

I think I named things well enough that the code speaks (the logic) for itself. Although I must agree that the load of new functions here would require one going throught he racket docs. I did, I also referred to the prologue chapter in the book as well. Personally I didnt enjoy this graphics exercise. I just dont find graphics work fun.

exercises 6's code imports an image so i'm skipping it, just refer to my github repo to see my solution

exercise 7: Suppose you want to decide whether today is an appropriate day to go to the mall. You go to the mall either if it is not sunny or if today is Friday. Now create an expression that computes whether sunny is false or friday is true. 

Eee-zee. lol. Just boolean

```racket
(define sunny #true)
(define friday #false)

;; whether sunny or false or friday is true
; except result should be false
(or (not sunny)
    friday)
```

boolean review

Checks whether any of the given Boolean values is #true (#t also works as an alias):

	> (or #true #true)
	#true
	> (or #true #false)
	#true
	> (or #false #true)
	#true
	> (or #false #false)
	#false

checks whether all of the given Boolean values are #true:

      > (and #true #true)
      #true
      > (and #true #false)
      #false
      > (and #false #true)
      #false
      > (and #false #false)
      #false

not always picks the Boolean that isn’t given: 

	> (not #true)
	#false

Anyhow to end this post, yet again as usual, here's a pic of my doggo from this day's walk
