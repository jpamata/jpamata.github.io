Ahh yes... another blog post on this diy-bootcamp series, where I post daily about what I did along with some of my lazy notes for the day.

Today I began my studies into web development. I'm still doing HTDP, but after yesterday's diy-bootcamp post, we could see that it's not really worth something to blog about as I'm just doing exercises from the book. Anyone can see those on my github. But then again, I am also still blogging about days where I dont even do anything. Those are for accountability though, to make me push myself after writing a blog post about a day where I slacked off.

I guess to make the blog more interesting, on the side, I'm learning web development. I also began making an outline of what this DIY Programming Bootcamp would look like in the next few months.

It looks like this:

## DIY Programming Bootcamp Curriculum v0.1

May

↪ FOCUS: Learn how to think like a good programmer with [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/)
b

↪ SIDE QUEST: Learn some web development, just the basics

June

↪ FOCUS: Web Development

↪ SIDE QUEST: Learn some Java

July

↪ FOCUS: Build a portfolio

↪ SIDE QUEST: Learn Algorithms

August

↪ FOCUS: Algorithms Grind

↪ SIDE QUEST: Build a portfolio

Of course, I likely wont follow the above plan. It's more fun to just follow what keeps me interested. What matters nonetheless is that I keep coding every day. Another important thing is that I learn programming right with classic books like HtDP/[How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/). 

 Anyhow, here's the update for today

# HTML and CSS

Let's look at some basics of HTML and CSS today.

What is HTML? CSS?

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language : basically the structure of the webpage

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets : it tells the webpage how things work, basically describes things in the page


# Let's start first with HTML


Let's start with some basic HTML tags

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
``` 

this tells that the website is using the latest html

```html
<html>
```

this is the "root element" where all the things you're adding to the website will end up in. This is the opening tag, and the closing tag, denoted with an angular bracket followed by a forward slash or this one, <code></</code>, are where you put your content.

```html
<head>
```

head element is basically the background information of your website. Can contain the metadata for search engines looking for your website

```html
<title>I'm the Title</title>
```

what you put here, between the opening and closing tags for the title, displays the text element you can see in the tab in your browser, which in this case it gives "I'm the Title"

```html
</head>
```

```html
<body>
```

body opening tag. this is where all the content that is shown in visually to the users of your website

```html
<!-- a comment -->
```

A comment, does not render in the page. Meant for programmers reading the code. 

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
```

Header text. There are other header elements. h1 denotes the main heading and thus has a larger font size than the rest.

```html
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
```

header text, an h2 header element. Less of a priority than h1, it is thus smaller.

```html
<p>a paragraph</p> 
```

paragraph tag, for blocks of texts which in this case is "a paragraph"

Because as we said it's <u>a block</u>, there's an empty space before and after the paragraph.

```html
</body>
```

closing tag for the body

```html
</html>
```
closing tag for html

Now here's all the html tags mentioned above, used

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>I'm the Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- a comment -->
		<h1>Heading 1</h1>
		<h2>Heading 2</h2>
		<p>a paragraph</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

And this is the output

# On HTML Nesting

As we could see from the code above, html tags are sometimes nested on top of another. Like the body tag contains heading tags and paragraphs. Or the head has the title tags. Or almost all of those tags, are nested inside the <code><html></code> and <code></html></code> tags

Here's a pic I found from [here](http://www.mrinitialman.com/Library/HTML/Chapters/HTML/HTML-Markup_Basics.html), typically nesting is done like the following:

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3eZQKuli9rryDYxywcgqpzpHJWnO3Quq9iA5ePnawTmlPBd6CNdENYPIV4VT-Xg1u42zK91pispanIeWVTec_OLyDRRwgMqrl_QkePEKYf3m6HcxvFVmkXn8TyBqeCjiJdvK27N5bvqEtUkq6fvLlBg=w406-h468-no?authuser=0">

# HTML Attributes

Now let's talk about attributes. The value we apply to attributes will apply to the content nested in the element.

Here's a common template of using an attribute in an html

```html
<html_tag attribute_name = "value">
	<!-- here we put some content -->
</closing_html_tag>
```

Perhaps the best way to illustrate the usage of attributes, is by making an html link

Suppose we want to make a link to google.com, and output the following

> [click me to go to google.com](https://www.google.com/)

following the example template for using an attribute shown above, here's the code behind it

```html

<a href="https://www.google.com/">
click me to go to google.com
</a>

```

In the above <code>a</code> is an html tag. It creates a hyperlink. <code>href</code> is its attribute. The href attribute is the desitination link. <code>"https://www.google.com"</code> is the value we give to the attribute. &lt;/a&gt; is the closing tag for the &lt;a&gt; tag.

<code>click me to go to google.com</code> is the content nested inside this tag and attribute, and thus the values we definied will be applied to it. Clicking any part of that text will bring us to google.com



# Note on hiatus

I've decided to take a hiatus from blogging. That's it. Just blogging. Typing out this blog post took AT LEAST 2 hours, as I had to reflect what I learned today, plan what of those to write, structure the post, and edit it over and over so it looks like it's a highschool student's notes on AP Computer Science or something. Yeah it looks easy and half-assed, but it is what it is. Some people are just very self-critical of their writing and I think that's what kept me. Likely because I'm not used to writing technical pieces yet.

Later once I get into complex topics, it's pretty obvious to expect that I'll be spending more than 2 hours on writing posts. Then add handling my business ventures into this, and <em>I would barely have enough time for this DIY Programming Bootcamp!</em>

Thus, I wont be blogging again til probably a few months from now. By then I'll go back and back-publish daily posts accordingly to their day. So if you're viewing this from like 2022, you'll (hopefully) see like as if nothing happened, that there's a DIY-bootcamp post for April 30, and the next, and the next...

So it's all silence for me from now for this series. See you again in perhaps a couple months. Though what's more likely is me reviving this series around the time I'm finishing this 140-day D.I.Y. Programming Bootcamp.

BUT! If you want to know about my latest progress, you can see my github at [github.com/johnamata](). If you want a study buddy, just feel free to email me. My email's found [here](https://johnamata.com/about).

ALSO! I may still blog every now and then when I feel like the blog post wont take longer than an hour. But guaranteed, I will come back to this series later to publish all daily posts when I have the time.

To end the post, just as usual from this series, here's a pic of my furry friend from today's walk
