## 2021-04-15

Last night, I went to sleep early as I was having blurry vision. It freaked  me out. Usually I just close my eyes for awhile then after I open it, my vision starts to refocus on things again. It's not really a common occurence, but I've had episodes of it since I was a kid (as early as 2nd grade). I dont  think it's really that big of an issue, (though other doctors disputed the diagnosis) I was diagnosed with glaucoma when I was young yet more than 10 years later, I still have good vision! Well, 25-50 according to last year's checkup.

So this vision problem then is more likely because I'm in front of the computer or phone at least 16-18 hours a day! It's the pandemic and all I'm doing is getting enthralled by pixels. The past few months, my eyes get twitchy, sometimes I get sharp pain on my right eye. Last night, I had VERY blurry vision. Fortunately this morning the severity receded, it's still blurry but now I can see far away things clearly and can read text. 

I need a break. <u>Thus I decided to take a break from computers for about 2 weeks.</u> I realised quickly that such a thing is impossible to do, thus I regressed the conditions to just limiting myself to a max of 1 hour of computer use each day, and when I'm typing things (like this blog post), I'm going to have to close my eyes to further lessen eye-screen time.

Today, I looked for some things to do without the computer. I thought of math, because sometimes the only thing that stops you from writing a program is your background in math. So I looked for books around the house. I came across a book on Discrete Math from college lying around and realised that I've never really used it. I mostly just relied on the powerpoint slides and PDF notes that our professor gave us during my discrete math course to pass the exams. And like your typical college course, we never got to cover even 1/4 of the topics in the assigned main textbook for the course.

I remember [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)'s [interview](https://youtu.be/YjyaYCLJQXw) on how he got good enough for CS mathematics.


> “Don, I think you’re going to be a failure in college”. He said, you know, you’ve done well here in high school, but college is completely different, and you’re just, you know, it’s just going to be too much for you, you’re not going to, you aren’t going to make it. And, well, so he scared me again, and when I got to college I kept studying.
>
> In fact, just the week before college, the Dean of Students, whoever it was, told us. I went to Case institute of Technology in Cleveland, which was at that time not yet connected with Western Reserve University. So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, says, it’s a all men’s school, says, “Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail.” So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
>
> I, the calculus book that I had, in high school we — in high school, as I said, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren’t, you know, that weren’t assigned by the teacher. The teacher would assign, so this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas, and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.
>
> But Thomas’s Calculus would have the text, then would have problems, and our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that. I would also do the odd numbered problems. <mark>In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems</mark>. I was, you know, I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. <mark>But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems.</mark> So it was good that I was scared, in a way that I, you know, that made me start strong, and then I could coast afterwards, rather than always climbing and being on a lower part of the learning curve.
Going over the contents of this book, it seems like this is of much more use to me in the long run. [George Hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) himself [in one of his streams from 2020](https://youtu.be/N2bXEUSAiTI) said (starts at 51:29) 

> Most of my math knowledge is in discrete math, I don't know that much.
Yet he's done well for himself and is working on bleeding edge applied AI tech (though arguably most maths in daytoday machine learning and data science nowadays is easily abstracted now by libraries and tools). Discrete math looks like a good thing to build a CS math foundation on.

There's 900 pages of exercises and lessons on this book. 

<u>If I can just go over and do 2 pages a day, I could finish this book by sometime next year.</u> 

Even less if I just skip the exercises with no solutions at the back. Pretty good to me.

No notes today, wrote them all on the book and did exercises on the paper.

Still on a break from computers, I opened my macbook today as I couldnt reist the temptation. I just checked my mails and I had just read the an email from a well accomplished database professor. Earlier I emailed him for some advice on learning the internals and implementations of databases. He replied by giving me some resources as well as his book. I checked out his book and it's perfect. I'd like to talk about it, but it might attract some unintended attention and in turn, he'll start getting spam emails.

With this, I looked for some open source database projects I could work on in the future, and ones that caught my eye are cockroachDB and trinoDB. One is built in Go and the latter is built in Java.

I downloaded the code and created my own "toy repo" for it, then I looked into the codebase which is of course, HUGE. Couldnt understand a single thing. That's not MY problem though, that's my FUTURE ME's problem. Step by step, little by little, that's how we go. Learn some Java and GO first, then some databases, and google what I dont understand in the codebase. That's the plan.

After that, I didnt do much today. Still on that eye strain break. I'm thinking about 10 days of this break. My eyes get really itchy when staring on the screen, despite wearing glasses.

As usual, here's today's walk with doggo

## 2021-04-18 - Mum's birthday

Did nothing today. Took my Eye Strain break seriously today as well as today's mom's birthday. As it's COVID time, it's just a small family gathering. We ate cake, spaghetti, pancit, and other stuff in the garden and had some talks. 

Here's a pic of doggo at the patio near the garden

Did nothing today. Went to the  mall to head to the eye doctor. Also did some window shopping and looked for some Math books. I thought that if my eye strain lasts long, I could probably just do some math books to keep myself productive. Anyhow, here's some pics from the trip.

The mall. Usually it's full of people, now it's almost empty. A year ago, this was really empty as heck.

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3egY2Fdz0q67Xqf4DUVRgeOfLy-tkJ65urvtN8XtfrfZH_QjIFMkFSbVeqqWwjcMaDcBrHpmUu5mFAFBRGqoCei35XLhgxxzMHt0DcIRNfzYT4LPB3AQe_cTrsLZY81gAYjFIZ2PfnumEV4GbtNvkRH=w1856-h1392-no?authuser=0">

Window shopping for some glasses. Doc saays I need a new pair of glasses. I'm heading to another doc tomorrow for 2nd opinion.

Didnt find any math books, the bookstore here isnt selling any college textbooks. Must be because for the whole school year, all schools in the country (or perhaps not for the far flung areas) are doing online/distance education. Perhaps thatll continue til next year with the way things are going.

Did nothing today. Still on that eye strain break. I went out for 2nd opinion from a doctor for my eyes. Then I got some new prescription glasses at another mall (not the one from yesterday).

Check it out

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fYR6it3r7KkJ8kE3YrHpikIMcRZXyh0kWPuCa7_tSoSbKKAFxqmdhn_av4f_kGhOY_EsU187xYHctlvDKqeeFaX3ABx7vQ2U5otG7R_NBfl6YaF_rFt2YTR2weVbZRZ5rBq5pJuMd2jtBIBctq6lKd=w1856-h1392-no?authuser=0">

The glasses are tinted brown kind of like gunnar glasses for blue light protection. Then there's a 2nd lens underneath it, again with antiradiation, albeit it's not tinted. The 2nd lens is the one with prescription. One can remove the other tinted lens if they want to. I personally won't. I dont want to get that eye strain again. The eye strain I'm having the past few days spooked me. Especially the first night, felt like I was going blind with how blurry things were going.

After not being able to find a math book yesterday from the other mall's bookstore, I tried my luck here, at a larger bookstore. Unfortunately they also dont have college textbooks thanks to education from primary school to college being online thanks to coronachan.

All I did was watch cobra kai the entire day. I loved it. Pretty motivating. The character is pretty based and it's like a story of (dragonball) Vegeta's redemption. I'm just about to finish season 1.

 My eyes still arent full health, but I can do coding now. I pretty much just watched some Cobra Kai, finished season 2 and watched some movies.

Didnt do a single thing today. I'm still having some eye strain but I'm getting better, so I should be doing stuff today but I didnt. I didnt have a plan. That's what I shouldve done, made a todo this morning or the night before. 

I just watched all Cobra Kai episodes so far. One of the best TV series I've watched man. Though I didnt like how some parts of it werent focused on Cobra Kai man himself and his sense Reese, which is my 2nd fave character in the series (writers did a good job), the final episodes of the season make up for it.

Waiting for season 4!

For now, as usual to end this post, a pic of my doggo from today's walk
