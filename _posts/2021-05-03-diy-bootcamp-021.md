I took a break today from studies. The day was spent just reading the previous blog posts and reading about tech/programming randomly. I also got a new toy for my dog, check it out

See you all tomorrow, let's hope the next day is better. And oh, I just added a new feature on this website: links to the previous and the next posts (if they exist) at the footer. That way it's easier to read through these daily posts.

As usual to end this post like most of the others, here's a pic of my doggo from today's walk
