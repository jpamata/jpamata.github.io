My Java notes are behind my studies. Yes, in my last notes on Java for this series, which was on Day 20 ([read here](/articles/2021/05/02/diy-bootcamp-020.html)) as Day 21 was a break, we left with  how to read input in Java with BufferedReaders. 

My java knowledge is beyond those notes, which is why you could see that I'm spouting java code in the following leetcode solutions that haven't been noted of in the previous blog posts. 

You see, those Java notes I'm doing are just for me to understand the fundamentals of Java better, which I'm slowly doing so. And it takes time for me to think and write about these notes. Hell, that Day 20 blog post took me about 2 hours to write.

# Uhhh LeetCode

I've started doing some leetcode/LC problems to prep for coding interviews in the future, because grinding algorithm problems is now the sorry state of the oversaturated industry today. I found them to be hard. Some people would laugh at me for saying that, but I guess some people are just good at other things while being bad at other things. And I think that's the reason for these leetcodish interviews, a way to separate those who can grind or those who have natural aptitude (quite a few) from the rest. Many [extremely talented devs like this guy](https://youtu.be/85cXj76YGQE) cant do an LC hard unless they have prior experience practing it. It's already been establish too that such interviews are not about finding a great programmer, rather it's about finding a way to reduce the number of applicants to interview quickly. Now that may seem like a rant, but I'm glad LC interviewing exists, because one can just grind enough for months and a crap programmer like me can be on par with or even be better than great devs for at least those few hours on the interview rounds

I'm gonna start putting the solutions here: [https://github.com/johnamata/solve](https://github.com/johnamata/solve)

The leetcode May 2021 Daily challenge yesterday was [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/), so I gave it a shot. The problem is a nice introduction to prefix sums [read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum).

Here's my code with notes, to check it on leetcode, just take the runningSum method

```java

import java.util.Arrays;

/**
 * 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/
 */
public class leetcode_easy_1480_running_sum_1d_array {
    public static int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
        //we start at zero so 1st element doesnt change when we do
        //runningSum += nums[i];
        int runningSum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            //we just keep summing, adding value from previous to current
            runningSum += nums[i];
            //change the value of the current index to that of our running sum/running total
            nums[i] = runningSum;
        }
        return nums;
    }
    //test
    public static void main(String[]args){
        int[] arr = {1,2,3,4};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(runningSum(arr)));
    }
}

```

I found this [14 Patterns to Ace Any Coding Interview Question
](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed) article to be useful for my future journey, and I plan to review it every week or so.

# Github Graph

Now I would like to talk about a lot of more things that I did today and learned, but it looks like I do need a hiatus from blogging, like I said on my post [here](/articles/2021/04/29/diy-bootcamp-017.html). Since starting this daily blogging series in about the mid of April, I have not done much programming apart from the basics. We could look at github profile's activity graph below

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fVGpMCZNnPISwIdj3iR_F6FyG7sdSWM7V4lxJ-jrtvFdTbFEjH2V7qf1ZUQEA069qWrgqtkUjN3pS0JupbJmJr9hpsFibSbNWitdJQ8nKVevBVpAZKw5vWYBghe2SesnS_7aSxj828ikhhac29TuWU=w2298-h962-no?authuser=0">

All the commits I've done since starting this blog series were pretty much just creating some study repositories. That's it. Meanwhile at least the commits I've done from the past year were about actual code. I spent more time thinking about what I'm going to study today for the blog series and then studying those, than actually doing some real studying - doing hard problems and projects. It's pretty hard to write a compelling daily devlog so I didnt do any projects.

But now, I feel like this blog series is just holding me back. Perhaps I should do what I said on my day 17 post:

>I’ve decided to take a hiatus from blogging. That’s it. Just blogging. Typing out this blog post took AT LEAST 2 hours, as I had to reflect what I learned today, plan what of those to write, structure the post, and edit it over and over so it looks like it’s a highschool student’s notes on AP Computer Science or something. Yeah it looks easy and half-assed, but it is what it is. Some people are just very self-critical of their writing and I think that’s what kept me. Likely because I’m not used to writing technical pieces yet.
>
>Later once I get into complex topics, it’s pretty obvious to expect that I’ll be spending more than 2 hours on writing posts. Then add handling my business ventures into this, and I would barely have enough time for this DIY Programming Bootcamp!
>
>Thus, I wont be blogging again til probably a few months from now. By then I’ll go back and back-publish daily posts accordingly to their day. So if you’re viewing this from like 2022, you’ll (hopefully) see like as if nothing happened, that there’s a DIY-bootcamp post for April 30, and the next, and the next…
>
>So it’s all silence for me from now for this series. See you again in perhaps a couple months. Though what’s more likely is me reviving this series around the time I’m finishing this 140-day D.I.Y. Programming Bootcamp.

But then if I do take a break, I know that going back to edit these posts to complete the series would still take a lot of time. So it may be best to just either end this series or just simply blog about what I did today, and forget the lessons. Just blog about something like:

> oh hey guys, I did 2 leetcode problems today. that's it. bye. here's a pic of my pet dog from our walk
>
> [insert pic here]

I guess that sounds better. As this blog series is just for my accountability to do this study program anyway. Anyhow, we'll see...
