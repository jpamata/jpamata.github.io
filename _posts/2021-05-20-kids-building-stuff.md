Today as I was walking my dog, I saw a group of kids heading towards our trail, talking nonchalanty to each other as they ride their mountainbikes. They stopped for a bit just in front of us thinking of the next thing that they should do. It reminded me back of when I was a kid, we'd often sometimes stop by to take a quick break and think of what game we should play next.

Should we play hide and seek? Tag?

Those were the times. But kids are different these days, those types of games aren't played anymore. 

And it showed: the kids in front me talked about playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">minecraft</a> next. But what surprised me was they didn't mean playing the video game itself. They talked about playing minecraft in the real world. They began planning the rules for their game, collecting certain types and shapes of rocks are equivalent to something in the minecraft world, rules for crafting new items, and tagging real world objects (ex. cars, some certain types of people and dogs) as their zombie enemies that they shouldnt go near with or they're "dead." I dont know minecraft so their jargons just flew over my head. But it was impressive how they exercised their imagination. They're natural makers.

In 2017 when I was still a student, I read a post in Hacker News titled [When You Are Depressed, Make Something ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13365430) and the title hit me. It pulled me out of my slacking at university and made me go back to working on my undergrad thesis. Later I read that post again during my [8-month internship](/articles/2017/12/12/my-internship-willis-towers-watson.html) and made me decide to take up an initiative project.

I think I need to build something. Do it end to end.
