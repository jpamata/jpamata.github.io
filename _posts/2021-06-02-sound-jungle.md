I remember when I was a kid and travelling across Bicol when it wasn’t that much developed, full of trees and so green. There’s this “sound of the jungle” kind of thing that used to exist. And being a kid, hearing those things, it made me wonder about the monsters in the dark. I thought of things like ghosts, ghouls, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manananggal">manananggals</a>, and even a giant alligator hiding across the foliage.

I remember being around 5 or 8 years old, camping in a tent by the farm, having thoughts like:

> “what if I wake up in the middle of the night to find a white lady (PH folklore) or a werewolf looking back at me?”

I miss that. I miss being young and having those things to fear. At my age now, the fear is more about the thoughts you hear when you're around people:

- “Am I going to succeed?”

- “When will I be happy?”

- “Why am I so afraid of committing to this project?”

- “Is she the right woman?”

- “How many years or days do I have left to spend with grandparents?”

For some, these fears are more striking. Because unlike the fears you have when you were a kid, they don’t go once the night turns to day. They sit there at the back of your mind, waiting for you to accept it.

I'm missing the sound of the jungle

But recently, I've been thinking about the death of a doctor I'm close with, he passed away from COVID last year.

Slowly it has brought to my attention about the inevitable ebbing towards death. 

Now I am a man who has just started his 20s. Reflecting on my life, it is quite impressive to think that if you take my life as it is, a man on his 20s, and you backtrack it recursively through time... it would take just about 100 generations of me living through my 20s to get you back to the time Christianity was born. If you put it in that scale, 2000 years suddenly doesn't look that long! 

Even more mindblowing is if we suppose that if the human life expectancy is around our 40s (it's the average until the 19th century), there's only about 50 generations of humans from today to that era. To think of the inventions that we as a species have done, the wonders that we have built, and the knowledge that we have uncovered is a testament to how we can overcome our fears and push through.

So yes, life is short. But in the context of the history of human civilization, the time we get is enough to leave a mark.

There'll be more strange sights and sounds to come, and I'm looking forward to the future
