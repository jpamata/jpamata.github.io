<p align="justify">Hi! I'm John, but you can call me Ice as most of my friends do. I'm a computer science undergrad from Asia Pacific College. </p>								
<p align="justify">Other than being busy in computer science, I also have various interests and hobbies. I'm a voracious reader, I read at least one book a week. I mostly read non-fiction, like Autobiographies, Self-Improvement, Business, Science, and recently, Mathematics. </p>
<p align="justify">I'm also a disciplined goal setter. Every year, I'd set up goals for myself and accomplish them. Thanks to that habit, it brought me some joys and skills in life: I learned to play the guitar, the piano, started hitting the gym and am strong enough to deadlift my bodyweight, and lately, learned some niche fields in computer science - natural language processing and machine learning.</p>
<p align="justify">On the topic of CS, I was never the guy who was into computers, even though I came from a technical school, Don Bosco Technical Institute - Makati. In time though, I have found that it is indeed a rewarding path to take in life. </p>

<p align="justify">Currently? I'm busying myself with machine learning as I prepare for grad school and getting my hands dirty with this blockchain hype. </p>
