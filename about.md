<big><strong>Hello!</strong></big> I'm John, but some of my friends call me either Ice or JP.
</p>

<p align = "justify">
I started learned programming when I was 10, with HTML/CSS. Mostly it was all because of school. Because of my academic performance, I was placed into a specialized program in electronics when I was 12, and that was when I was exposed to C programming for robotics. I eventually entered college when I was around 14 and majored in Accounting as my parents at the time wanted me to become a CPA-Lawyer.

Disenchanted with business studies, I dropped out, took a 1 year break to cope with depression that started growing when I was 13 (but only diagnosed later when I was 16-17), and then enrolled at a different school. That was when I majored in Computer Science, and when this journey of learning to love programming, began. I recently graduated with a <a href="/photos/jpamata-bscs.JPG">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</a> and had started working on software development.
</p>

<p align="justify">Outside of work and education, in my free time I like to spend my time learning the electronic keyboard, the <a href="/photos/playing-guitar-in-2009.jpg">guitar</a>, reading non-fiction books, and baking. I'm not much of a sporty guy. Nowadays I just lift weights at home, but in highschool I was part of the school's <a href="/photos/footballsoccer.jpg">soccer/football team</a>.
