<p align="justify">Hi! I'm John, but you can call me Ice as most of my friends do. I'm a computer science undergrad from Asia Pacific College. </p>								
<p align="justify">Other than being busy in computer science, I also have various interests and hobbies. I'm a voracious reader, I read at least one book a week. I mostly read non-fiction, like History, Autobiographies, Self-Improvement, Business, Science, and recently, Mathematics. </p>
<p align="justify">I'm also a disciplined goal setter. Every year, I'd set up goals for myself and accomplish them. Thanks to that habit, it brought me some joys and skills in life: I learned to play the guitar, the piano, started hitting the gym and am strong enough to deadlift my bodyweight, and lately, learned some niche fields in computer science - natural language processing and machine learning.</p>
<p align="justify">On the topic of CS, I was never the guy who was into computers, even though I came from a technical school, Don Bosco Technical Institute - Makati. In time though, I have found that it is indeed a rewarding path to take in life. </p> 
<p align="justify">Why? Because I like creating and shipping things. If you think about it, in the world we live today, it just something magical that you could have an idea, put it into reality, and ship it to the public solely through great use of your skill and the abundant computational power everywhere. That's the exact vision that is just enchanting about studying computer science, and one day, I'll have a few of my products out in the market.</p>
<p align="justify">Currently? I'm busying myself with studying blockchain development and looking at web frameworks for rapid MVP development for a startup.</p>
