<p>Hi! I'm John, but you can call me Ice as most of my friends do. I'm a computer science undergrad from Asia Pacific College.</p>

<p>Other than being busy in computer science, I also have various interests and hobbies. I'm a voracious reader, I read at least one book a week. I mostly read non-fiction, like Autobiographies, Self-Improvement, Business, Science, and recently, Mathematics.</p>

<p>My most proud trait, is being a disciplined goal setter. Every year, I'd set up goals for myself and accomplish them. Thanks to that habit, it brought me some joys and skills in life: I learned to play the guitar, the piano, started hitting the gym and am strong enough to deadlift my bodyweight, and over time, learned some niche fields in computer science - natural language processing and machine learning.</p>

<p>On the topic of CS, I was never the guy who was into computers, even though I came from a technical school, Don Bosco Technical Institute - Makati. In time though, I have found that it is indeed a rewarding path to take in life. There is nothing more rewarding than creating your own product and shipping it to the public.</p>

<p>Currently? I'm busying myself with machine learning as I prepare for grad school. I'm also getting swayed by this blockchain hype and started getting my hands dirty with the tech.</p>
