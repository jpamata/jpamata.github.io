## Hi
<p align="justify">Welcome to my thinking space, my stash of notes and essays collected from my cabinet of curiosities. I blog about the stuff I learn so I can better remember them, using the power of the <a href="https://curiosity.com/topics/learn-anything-in-four-steps-with-the-feynman-technique-curiosity/">Feynman method</a> of learning, which is all about creating efficient feedback loops for learning. To learn more about why I blog, please read this <a href="http://johnamata.com/misc/2016/06/23/i-blog-because.html">post</a>.</p>

## About me
<p align="justify">Some of my friends call me John, while some call me Ice. I'm a computer science undergrad from Asia Pacific College.</p>

<p align="justify">Other than being busy in computer science, I also have various interests and hobbies. I'm a voracious reader, I read at least one book a week. I mostly read non-fiction, like Autobiographies, Self-Improvement, Business, Science, and recently, Mathematics.</p>

<p align="justify">My most proud trait, is being a disciplined goal setter. Every year, I'd set up goals for myself and accomplish them. Thanks to that habit, it brought me some joys and skills in life: I learned to play the guitar, the piano, started hitting the gym and am strong enough to deadlift my bodyweight, and over time, learned some niche fields in computer science - natural language processing and machine learning.</p>

<p align="justify">On the topic of CS, I was never the guy who was into computers, even though I came from a technical school, Don Bosco Technical Institute - Makati. In time though, I have found that it is indeed a rewarding path to take in life. There is nothing more rewarding than creating your own product and shipping it to the public.</p>

## What I'm Up To
<p align="justify">Currently, I am learning react by going through books from <a href="https://www.packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a> and <a href="https://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a>. I am also learning C by building my own database, text editor, and interpreter.</p>

<h2>Bookshelf</h2>
<p align="justify">A list of books that influenced me.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Arnold: Education of a Bodybuilder by Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> for showing me that confidence is built by victories and success, and that smart, hard work trumps all.</li>
	<li><strong>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! by Richard Feynman</strong> for showing me how to enjoy life and to always carry curiosity.</li>
	<li><strong>Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes</strong> for showing me how beautiful literature can be.</li>
	<li><strong>The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss</strong> for showing me that there's something else other than working.</li>
	<li><strong>Introduction to Algorithms by C., L., R., S.</strong> for bruising my ego and showing me how little knowledge I have of computer science.</li>
	<li><strong>Category Theory for the Sciences by David Spivak</strong> for giving me a mental model when thinking about problems and making me (after several years) fall in love with math.</li>
</ol>
