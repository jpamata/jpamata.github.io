	<h2>2010-2020</h2>
	<p>Great books I remember reading when I was in my early teens to my early twenties. To be specific, I read them from 2012-2016 with the exception of Greenlights. <mark>I have no notes from them</mark>, perhaps I'll revisit them later and make notes. For now, clicking their photos goes to their goodreads page.</p>
