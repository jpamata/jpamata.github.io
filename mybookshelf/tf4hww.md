- At its core the book is about lifestyle design to become what Tim refers to as the *New Rich*, a group of people who maximise for freedom and mobility. Tech made plenty of the advice in this book obsolete, but nonetheless, the idea of planning one's path towards Tim's "New Rich" lifestyle is what I feel makes this book worth it

- You dont have to quit your job or retire early

- What's the worst that could happen? Experiments outside the norm often cost nothing, especially in a world where everyone is failing

> Flash forward to 2011; is a job interviewer asking about that unusual gap year?
>
> “Everyone was getting laid off and I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to travel around the world. It was incredible.”

- <mark>People dont want to be a millionaire, they want the experience they think being a millionaire has.</mark> Oftentimes, you dont need that much money at all.

- Tim has these 3 questions for an entrepreneurship lecture he gave at Princeton

>How do your decisions change if retirement isn’t an option?
>
> What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferred-life plan reward before working 40 years for it?
>
> Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire?”
