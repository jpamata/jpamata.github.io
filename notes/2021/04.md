- [The Google File System](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf) uses a master slave architecture thus failure of master stops the service. Files Persistence is kept by logging on local and replicating to remote machines. Master operations are fast as metadata is stored in memory. Files are divided into fixed size chunks in chunk servers. Chunk size is 64MB. Each chunk is stored as a plain linux file, and for reliability, there are 3 replicas. GFS does a lot of replication, as well as of snapshots (of files and directory trees) Because of replication, it consumes more raw storage than xFS and swift. Because we store as plain linux files, caching file data is not done and GFS just uses the linux buffer memory. <u>idea: make a more detailed blog post about this.</u>
- Oracle CLoud free tiers has a 2 Compute virtual machines with 1/8 OCPU and 1 GB memory each.
