<h2>Projects</h2>

<p align="justify">This page is just for me to get an overview of my projects at my new github (<a href="https://github.com/bradp1tt">@bradp1tt</a>). These projects are solely for the sake of my education & interest, not to serve as a portfolio or a reflection of how I write production code.</p>

- Utilized: Java
- My solutions to algorithmic problems in platforms such as leetcode and codeforces, and other competitive programming platforms. Only the contents of the directory named coding-simplified contains code that aren't mine; it's from a series of youtube tutorials about algorithms.

> <a href="https://github.com/bradp1tt/python-algorithms">github.com/bradp1tt/python-algorithms</a>

- Utilized: Python
- Akin to my problem-solving repository, but this time the solutions are in python and some of the code were taken from books and courses. I mostly use it for my review while problem-solving repository is for competitive programming.
